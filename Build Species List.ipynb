       "  'abstract': \"The scale at which analyses are performed can have an effect on model results and often one scale does not accurately describe the ecological phenomena of interest (e.g., population trends) for wide‐ranging species: yet, most ecological studies are performed at a single, arbitrary scale. To best determine local and regional trends for greater sage‐grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in Wyoming, USA, we modeled density‐independent and ‐dependent population growth across multiple spatial scales relevant to management and conservation (Core Areas [habitat encompassing approximately 83% of the sage‐grouse population on ∼24% of surface area in Wyoming], local Working Groups [7 regional areas for which groups of local experts are tasked with implementing Wyoming's statewide sage‐grouse conservation plan at the local level], Core Area status (Core Area vs. Non‐Core Area) by Working Groups, and Core Areas by Working Groups). Our goal was to determine the influence of fine‐scale population trends (Core Areas) on larger‐scale populations (Working Group Areas). We modeled the natural log of change in population size (urn:x-wiley:14381656:media:jwmg21386:jwmg21386-math-0001 peak M lek counts) by time to calculate the finite rate of population growth (λ) for each population of interest from 1993 to 2015. We found that in general when Core Area status (Core Area vs. Non‐Core Area) was investigated by Working Group Area, the 2 populations trended similarly and agreed with the overall trend of the Working Group Area. However, at the finer scale where Core Areas were analyzed separately, Core Areas within the same Working Group Area often trended differently and a few large Core Areas could influence the overall Working Group Area trend and mask trends occurring in smaller Core Areas. Relatively close fine‐scale populations of sage‐grouse can trend differently, indicating that large‐scale trends may not accurately depict what is occurring across the landscape (e.g., local effects of gas and oil fields may be masked by increasing larger populations).

       "  'abstract': 'Sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems constitute the largest single North American shrub ecosystem and provide vital ecological, hydrological, biological, agricultural, and recreational ecosystem services. Disturbances have altered and reduced this ecosystem historically, but climate change may ultimately represent the greatest future risk. Improved ways to quantify, monitor, and predict climate-driven gradual change in this ecosystem is vital to its future management. We examined the annual change of Daymet precipitation (daily gridded climate data) and five remote sensing ecosystem sagebrush vegetation and soil components (bare ground, herbaceous, litter, sagebrush, and shrub) from 1984 to 2011 in southwestern Wyoming. Bare ground displayed an increasing trend in abundance over time, and herbaceous, litter, shrub, and sagebrush showed a decreasing trend. Total precipitation amounts show a downward trend during the same period. We established statistically significant correlations between each sagebrush component and historical precipitation records using a simple least squares linear regression. Using the historical relationship between sagebrush component abundance and precipitation in a linear model, we forecasted the abundance of the sagebrush components in 2050 using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) precipitation scenarios A1B and A2. Bare ground was the only component that increased under both future scenarios, with a net increase of 48.98 km2 (1.1%) across the study area under the A1B scenario and 41.15 km2 (0.9%) under the A2 scenario. The remaining components decreased under both future scenarios: litter had the highest net reductions with 49.82 km2 (4.1%) under A1B and 50.8 km2 (4.2%) under A2, and herbaceous had the smallest net reductions with 39.95 km2 (3.8%) under A1B and 40.59 km2 (3.3%) under A2. We applied the 2050 forecast sagebrush component values to contemporary (circa 2006) greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat models to evaluate the effects of potential climate-induced habitat change. Under the 2050 IPCC A1B scenario, 11.6% of currently identified nesting habitat was lost, and 0.002% of new potential habitat was gained, with 4% of summer habitat lost and 0.039% gained. Our results demonstrate the successful ability of remote sensing based sagebrush components, when coupled with precipitation, to forecast future component response using IPCC precipitation scenarios. Our approach also enables future quantification of greater sage-grouse habitat under different precipitation scenarios, and provides additional capability to identify regional precipitation influence on sagebrush component response.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Annual counts of males displaying at lek sites are an important tool for monitoring greater sage‐grouse populations (Centrocercus urophasianus), but seasonal and diurnal variation in lek attendance may increase variance and bias of trend analyses. Recommendations for protocols to reduce observation error have called for restricting lek counts to within 30\\u2009minutes of sunrise, but this may limit the number of lek counts available for analysis, particularly from years before monitoring was widely standardized. Reducing the temporal window for conducting lek counts also may constrain the ability of agencies to monitor leks efficiently. We used lek count data collected across Wyoming during 1995−2014 to investigate the effect of lek counts conducted between 30\\u2009minutes before and 30, 60, or 90\\u2009minutes after sunrise on population trend estimates. We also evaluated trends across scales relevant to management, including statewide, within Working Group Areas and Core Areas, and for individual leks. To further evaluate accuracy and precision of trend estimates from lek count protocols, we used simulations based on a lek attendance model and compared simulated and estimated values of annual rate of change in population size (λ) from scenarios of varying numbers of leks, lek count timing, and count frequency (counts/lek/year). We found that restricting analyses to counts conducted within 30\\u2009minutes of sunrise generally did not improve precision of population trend estimates, although differences among timings increased as the number of leks and count frequency decreased. Lek attendance declined >30\\u2009minutes after sunrise, but simulations indicated that including lek counts conducted up to 90\\u2009minutes after sunrise can increase the number of leks monitored compared to trend estimates based on counts conducted within 30\\u2009minutes of sunrise. This increase in leks monitored resulted in greater precision of estimates without reducing accuracy. Increasing count frequency also improved precision. These results suggest that the current distribution of count timings available in lek count databases such as that of Wyoming (conducted up to 90\\u2009minutes after sunrise) can be used to estimate sage‐grouse population trends without reducing precision or accuracy relative to trends from counts conducted within 30\\u2009minutes of sunrise. However, only 10% of all Wyoming counts in our sample (1995−2014) were conducted 61−90\\u2009minutes after sunrise, and further increasing this percentage may still bias trend estimates because of declining lek attendance.

       "  'abstract': 'Long‐term population monitoring is the cornerstone of animal conservation and management. The accuracy and precision of models developed using monitoring data can be influenced by the protocols guiding data collection. The greater sage‐grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a species of concern that has been monitored over decades, primarily, by counting the number of males that attend lek (breeding) sites. These lek count data have been used to assess long‐term population trends and for multiple mechanistic studies. However, some studies have questioned the efficacy of lek counts to accurately identify population trends. In response, monitoring protocols were changed to have a goal of counting lek sites multiple times within a season. We assessed the influence of this change in monitoring protocols on model accuracy and precision applying generalized additive models to describe trends over time. We found that at large spatial scales including >50 leks, the absence of repeated counts within a year did not significantly alter population trend estimates or interpretation. Increasing sample size decreased the model confidence intervals. We developed a population trend model for Wyoming greater sage‐grouse from 1965 to 2008, identifying significant changes in the population indices and capturing the cyclic nature of this species. Most sage‐grouse declines in Wyoming occurred between 1965 and the 1990s and lek count numbers generally increased from the mid‐1990s to 2008. Our results validate the combination of monitoring data collected under different protocols in past and future studies—provided those studies are addressing large‐scale questions. We suggest that a larger sample of individual leks is preferable to multiple counts of a smaller sample of leks.  © 2011 The Wildlife Society.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Human land use, such as livestock grazing, can have profound yet varied effects on wildlife interacting within common ecosystems, yet our understanding of land‐use effects is often generalized from short‐term, local studies that may not correspond with trends at broader scales. Here we used public land records to characterize livestock grazing across Wyoming, USA, and we used Greater Sage‐grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) as a model organism to evaluate responses to livestock management. With annual counts of male Sage‐grouse from 743 leks (breeding display sites) during 2004–2014, we modeled population trends in response to grazing level (represented by a relative grazing index) and timing across a gradient in vegetation productivity as measured by the Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI). We found grazing can have both positive and negative effects on Sage‐grouse populations depending on the timing and level of grazing. Sage‐grouse populations responded positively to higher grazing levels after peak vegetation productivity, but populations declined when similar grazing levels occurred earlier, likely reflecting the sensitivity of cool‐season grasses to grazing during peak growth periods. We also found support for the hypothesis that effects of grazing management vary with local vegetation productivity. These results illustrate the importance of broad‐scale analyses by revealing patterns in Sage‐grouse population trends that may not be inferred from studies at finer scales, and could inform sustainable grazing management in these ecosystems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystem is one of the largest ecosystems in western North America providing habitat for species found nowhere else. Sagebrush habitats have experienced dramatic declines since the 1950s, mostly due to anthropogenic disturbances. The greater sage‐grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a sagebrush‐obligate species that has experienced population declines over the last several decades, which are attributed to a variety of disturbances including the more recent threat of oil and gas development. We developed a hierarchical, Bayesian state‐space model to investigate the impacts of 2 measures of oil and gas development, and environmental and habitat conditions, on sage‐grouse populations in Wyoming, USA using male lek counts from 1984 to 2008. Lek attendance of male sage‐grouse declined by approximately 2.5%/year and was negatively related to oil and gas well density. We found little support for the influence of sagebrush cover and precipitation on changes in lek counts. Our results support those of other studies reporting negative impacts of oil and gas development on sage‐grouse populations and our modeling approach allowed us to make inference to a longer time scale and larger spatial extent than in previous studies. In addition to sage‐grouse, development may also negatively affect other sagebrush‐obligate species, and active management of sagebrush habitats may be necessary to maintain some species. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.',\n",

The IA is an integrated synthesis and analysis of WLCI resource values based on best available data and information collected from multiple agencies and organizations. It is a support tool for landscape-scale conservation planning and evaluation, and a data and analysis resource that can be used for addressing specific management questions. The IA analysis was conducted using a Geographic Information System in a raster (that is, a grid) environment using a cell size of 30 meters. To facilitate the interpretation of the data in a regional context, mean values were summarized and displayed at the subwatershed unit (WLCI subwatersheds were subset from the National Hydrography Dataset, Hydrologic Unit Code 12/Level 6). A dynamic mapping platform, accessed via the WLCI webpage at http://www.wlci.gov is used to display the mapped information, and to access underlying resource values that were combined to produce the final mapped results. The raster data used in the IA are provided here for use by interested parties to conduct additional analyses and can be accessed via the WLCI webpage.

       "  'abstract': 'The recent proliferation of oil and natural gas energy development in the Greater Green River Basin of southwest Wyoming has accentuated the need to understand wildlife responses to this development. The location and extent of surface disturbance that is created by oil and natural gas well pad scars are key pieces of information used to assess the effects of energy infrastructure on wildlife populations and habitat. A digital database of oil and natural gas pad scars had previously been generated from 1-meter (m) National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery (NAIP) acquired in 2009 for a 7.7-million hectare (ha) (19,026,700 acres) region of southwest Wyoming. Scars included the pad area where wellheads, pumps, and storage facilities reside and the surrounding area that was scraped and denuded of vegetation during the establishment of the pad. Scars containing tanks, compressors, the storage of oil and gas related equipment, and produced-water ponds were also collected on occasion. This report updates the digital database for the five counties of southwest Wyoming (Carbon, Lincoln, Sublette, Sweetwater, Uinta) within the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) study area and for a limited portion of Fremont, Natrona, and Albany Counties using 2012 1-m NAIP imagery and 2012 oil and natural gas well permit information. This report adds pad scars created since 2009, and updates attributes of all pad scars using the 2012 well permit information. These attributes include the origination year of the pad scar, the number of active and inactive wells on or near each pad scar in 2012, and the overall status of the pad scar (active or inactive). The new 2012 database contains 17,404 pad scars of which 15,532 are attributed as oil and natural gas well pads. Digital data are stored as shapefiles projected to the Universal Transverse Mercator (zones 12 and 13) coordinate system. These data are available from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) at http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ds934.',\n",

Regional land cover data seldom provide detailed information needed to support local management needs. Here we present a transferable framework to model forest cover by major plant functional type using aerial photos, multi-date Système Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) imagery, and topographic variables. We developed probability of occurrence models for deciduous broad-leaved forest and needle-leaved evergreen forest using logistic regression in the southern portion of the Wyoming Basin Ecoregion. The model outputs were combined into a synthesis map depicting deciduous and coniferous forest cover type. We evaluated the models and synthesis map using a field-validated, independent data source. Results showed strong relationships between forest cover and model variables, and the synthesis map was accurate with an overall correct classification rate of 0.87 and Cohen’s kappa value of 0.81. The results suggest our method adequately captures the functional type, size, and distribution pattern of forest cover in a spatially heterogeneous landscape.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent growth and development of renewable energy and unconventional oil and gas extraction are rapidly diversifying the energy supply of the United States. Yet, as our Nation works to advance energy security and conserve wildlife, some conflicts have surfaced. To address these challenges, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is conducting innovative research and developing workable solutions to reduce the impacts of energy production on wildlife. USGS scientists collaborate on many studies with scientists from other Federal, State, and local government agencies; Tribal nations; academic research institutions; and nongovernmental and private organizations.\\n\\nThe mix of fuels used for electricity generation is evolving. Solar, natural gas, and wind energy made up most electricity generation additions in 2015 and 2016. The United States now leads the world in natural gas production, with new record highs for each year from 2011 through 2015. More than 48,000 wind turbines now contribute to power grids in most States, providing about 5 percent of U.S. end-use electricity demand in an average year. The number of utility-scale solar-energy projects is growing rapidly with solar energy projected to contribute to the largest electricity generation addition in 2016.\\n\\nA substantial number of large energy projects have been constructed on undeveloped public lands, and more are anticipated at an increasing rate, creating new stress to wildlife. Direct impacts include collisions with wind turbines and structures at solar facilities and loss of habitat which may negatively affect sensitive species. Recent estimates suggest 250,000 to 500,000 birds die each year at wind turbine facilities. Bat fatality rates at wind turbine facilities are less certain, but may average several hundred thousand per year throughout North America. Because new projects may be located in or near sensitive wildlife habitats, ecological science plays a key role in helping to guide project siting and operational decisions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Time series of vegetative indices derived from satellite imagery constitute tools to measure ecological effects of natural and management-induced disturbances to ecosystems. Over the past century, sagebrush-reduction treatments have been applied widely throughout western North America to increase herbaceous vegetation for livestock and wildlife. We used indices from satellite imagery to 1) quantify effects of prescribed-fire, herbicide, and mechanical treatments on vegetative cover, productivity, and phenology, and 2) describe how vegetation changed over time following these treatments. We hypothesized that treatments would increase herbaceous cover and accordingly shift phenologies towards those typical of grass-dominated systems. We expected prescribed burns would lead to the greatest and most-prolonged effects on vegetative cover and phenology, followed by herbicide and mechanical treatments. Treatments appeared to increase herbaceous cover and productivity, which coincided with signs of earlier senescence − signals expected of grass-dominated systems, relative to sagebrush-dominated systems. Spatial heterogeneity for most phenometrics was lower in treated areas relative to controls, which suggested treatment-induced homogenization of vegetative communities. Phenometrics that explain spring migrations of ungulates mostly were unaffected by sagebrush treatments. Fire had the strongest effect on vegetative cover, and yielded the least evidence for sagebrush recovery. Overall, treatment effects were small relative to those reported from field-based studies for reasons most likely related to sagebrush recovery, treatment specification, and untreated patches within mosaicked treatment applications. Treatment effects were also small relative to inter-annual variation in phenology and productivity that was explained by temperature, snowpack, and growing-season precipitation. Our results indicated that cumulative NDVI, late-season phenometrics, and spatial heterogeneity of several phenometrics may serve as useful indicators of vegetative change in sagebrush ecosystems.',\n",

The simulated disturbance patterns produced by the footprint model are used to assess the potential effects on wildlife habitat and populations.

The management and effective use of spatial data becomes significantly more complex when the efforts involve a myriad of landscape-scale projects combined with a multiorganizational collaboration. There is sparse literature to guide users on this daunting subject; therefore, we present a framework of considerations for working with geospatial data that will provide direction to data stewards, scientists, collaborators, and managers for developing geospatial management plans. The concepts we present apply to a variety of geospatial programs or projects, which we describe as a “scalable framework” of processes for integrating geospatial efforts with management, science, and conservation initiatives. Our framework includes five tenets of geospatial data management: (1) the importance of investing in data management and standardization, (2) the scalability of content/efforts addressed in geospatial management plans, (3) the lifecycle of a geospatial effort, (4) a framework for the integration of geographic information systems (GIS) in a landscape-scale conservation or management program, and (5) the major geospatial considerations prior to data acquisition.

The goal of the workshop was to gather information from stakeholders about research needs and existing data resources to help develop the USGS WLCI science plan. The workshop focused on six research and management needs identified by WLCI partners prior to the workshop: *evaluate the cumulative effects of development activities; *identify key drivers of change; *identify condition and distribution of key wildlife species, habitat, and species habitat requirements; *evaluate wildlife and livestock responses to development; *develop an integrated inventory and monitoring strategy; and *develop a data clearinghouse and an information-management framework. These topics correlated to six plenary panels and discussions and six breakout sessions. Several collective needs were identified: *create a long-term, accessible information database; *identify key habitats, indicator species; *collect and research missing critical baseline data; *begin on-the-ground projects as soon as possible; and *implement a monitoring program to assist with adaptive management techniques. Several concerns were expressed repeatedly: *secure adequate and long-term funding; *meeting the WLCI workload with agencies that are already understaffed; *assess cumulative effects as an analysis approach; *perform offsite mitigation in a way that is valuable and effective; *focus all research on providing practical applications; and *involve the public in WLCI proceedings.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Southwestern Wyoming is an area of diverse scenery, wildlife, and natural resources that is actively undergoing energy development. The U.S. Department of the Interior's Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative is a long-term science-based effort to assess and enhance aquatic and terrestrial habitats at a landscape scale, while facilitating responsible energy development through local collaboration and partnerships. Water-quality monitoring has been conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey on the Green River near Green River, Wyoming, and Muddy Creek near Baggs, Wyoming. This monitoring, which is being conducted in cooperation with State and other Federal agencies and as part of the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative, is in response to concerns about potentially increased dissolved solids in the Colorado River Basin as a result of energy development. Because of the need to provide real-time dissolved-solids concentrations for the Green River and Muddy Creek on the World Wide Web, the U.S. Geological Survey developed regression equations to estimate dissolved-solids concentrations on the basis of continuous specific conductance using relations between measured specific conductance and dissolved-solids concentrations. Specific conductance and dissolved-solids concentrations were less varied and generally lower for the Green River than for Muddy Creek. The median dissolved-solids concentration for the site on the Green River was 318 milligrams per liter, and the median concentration for the site on Muddy Creek was 943 milligrams per liter. Dissolved-solids concentrations ranged from 187 to 594 milligrams per liter in samples collected from the Green River during water years 1999-2008. Dissolved-solids concentrations ranged from 293 to 2,485 milligrams per liter in samples collected from Muddy Creek during water years 2006-08. The differences in dissolved-solids concentrations in samples collected from the Green River compared to samples collected from Muddy Creek reflect the different basin characteristics. Relations between specific conductance and dissolved-solids concentrations were statistically significant for the Green River (p-value less than 0.001) and Muddy Creek (p-value less than 0.001); therefore, specific conductance can be used to estimate dissolved-solids concentrations. Using continuous specific conductance values to estimate dissolved solids in real-time on the World Wide Web increases the amount and improves the timeliness of data available to water managers for assessing dissolved-solids concentrations in the Colorado River Basin.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This is the sixth report produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) to detail annual activities conducted by USGS for addressing specific management needs identified by WLCI partners. In FY2013, there were 25 ongoing and new projects conducted by the USGS. These projects fall into 8 major categories: (1) synthesizing and analyzing existing data to describe (model and map) current conditions on the landscape; (2) developing models for projecting past and future landscape conditions; (3) monitoring indicators of ecosystem conditions and the effectiveness of on-the-ground habitat projects; (4) conducting research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying wildlife and habitat responses to changing land uses; (5) managing and making accessible the large number of databases, maps, and other products being developed; (6) helping to integrate WLCI outcomes with future habitat enhancement and research projects; (7) coordinating efforts among WLCI partners; and (8) providing support to WLCI decision-makers and assisting with overall evaluation of the WLCI program. The two new projects initiated in FY2013 address (1) important agricultural lands in southwestern Wyoming, and (2) the influence of energy development on native fish communities. The remaining activities entailed our ongoing efforts to compile data, model landscape conditions, monitor trends in habitat conditions, conduct studies of wildlife responses to energy development, and upgrade Web-based products in support of both individual and overall WLCI efforts. Milestone FY2013 accomplishments included completing the development of a WLCI inventory and monitoring framework and the associated monitoring strategies, protocols, and analytics; and initial development of an Interagency Inventory and Monitoring Database, which will be accessible through the Monitoring page of the WLCI Web site at http://www.wlci.gov/monitoring. We also completed the initial phase of the mountain shrub-mapping project in the Big Piney-La Barge mule deer winter range. Finally, a 3-year survey of pygmy rabbits in four major gas-field areas was completed and used to validate the pygmy rabbit habitat model/map developed earlier in the project. Important products that became available for use by WLCI partners included publication of USGS Data Series report (http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/800/pdf/ds800.pdf) that compiles our WLCI land cover and land use data, which depict current and historical patterns of sage-grouse habitat in relation to energy development and will be used to pose “what-if” scenarios to evaluate possible outcomes of alternative land-use strategies and practices on habitat and wildlife. Another important FY2013 product was a journal article (http://aapgbull.geoscienceworld.org/content/97/6/899.full) that describes the Mowry Shale and Frontier formation, which harbors coalbed methane and shale gas resources in Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah, for use in future scenario-building work. We also produced maps and databases that depict the structure and condition of aspen stands in the Little Mountain Ecosystem, and then presented this information to the Bureau of Land Management, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, and other interested entities for supporting aspen-management objectives.',\n",

The four new work activities were (1) development of the Western Energy Citation Clearinghouse, a Web-based energy-resource database of references for literature and on-line resources focused on energy development and its effects on natural resources; (2) a study to support the Sublette County Conservation District in ascertaining potential water-quality impacts to the New Fork River from energy development in the Pinedale Anticline Project Area; (3) a study to test the efficacy of blending high-frequency temporal data provided by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors and high-resolution Landsat data for providing the fine-resolution data required to evaluate habitat responses to management activities at the landscape level; and (4) a study to examine the seasonal water chemistry of Muddy Creek, including documenting salinity patterns and providing a baseline for assessing potential effects of energy and other development on water quality in the Muddy Creek watershed. Two work activities were completed in FY2011: (1) the assessment of rancher perceptions of energy development in Southwest Wyoming and (2) mapping aspen stands and conifer encroachment using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis for effectiveness monitoring. The USGS continued to compile data, develop geospatial products, and upgrade Web-based products in support of both individual and overall WLCI efforts, including (1) ranking and prioritizing proposed conservation projects, (2) developing the WLCI integrated assessment, (3) developing the WLCI 5-year Conservation Action Plan, and (4) continuing to upgrade the content and improve the functionality of the WLCI Web site. For the WLCI FY2012 annual report, a decision was made to greatly reduce the overall length of the annual report, which will be accomplished by simplifying the report format and focusing on the take-home messages of each work activity for WLCI partners.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This is the third report produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) to detail annual work activities. The first report described activities for 2007 and 2008, and the second report covered work activities for FY09. This third report covers work activities conducted in FY2010, and it continues the 2009 approach of reporting on all the individual activities to help give WLCI partners and other readers the full scope of what has been accomplished. New in this year's report is an additional section for each work activity that outlines the work planned for the following fiscal year. In FY2010, there were 35 ongoing/expanded, completed, or new projects conducted under the five major multi-disciplinary science and technical-assistance activities: (1) Baseline Synthesis; (2) Targeted Monitoring and Research; (3) Data and Information Management; (4) Integration and Coordination; and (5) Decisionmaking and Evaluation. The three new work activities were to (1) compile existing water data for the entire WLCI region and (2) develop regional curves (statistical models) for relating bankfull-channel geometry and discharge to drainages in the WLCI region, both of which will help guide long-term monitoring of water resources; and (3) initiate a groundwater-monitoring network to evaluate potential effects of energy-development activities on groundwater quality where groundwater is an important source of public/private water supplies. Results of the FY2009 work to develop methods for assessing soil organic matter and mercury indicated that selenium and arsenic levels may be elevated in the Muddy Creek Basin; thus, the focus of that activity was shifted in FY2010 to evaluate biogeochemical cycling of elements in the basin. In FY2010, two ongoing activities were expanded with the addition of more sampling plots: (a) the study of how greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) use vegetation-treatment areas (sites added to the Moxa Arch Natural Gas Development area) and (2) the study of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) occurrence in burn treatments of the Little Mountain Ecosystem. The activity that entails evaluating relationships between ungulate herbivory and fire on aspen (Populus tremuloides) recruitment also was expanded to include relationships between stand characteristics of and herbivory on aspen in various ecohydrological settings. The USGS continued compiling data and developing geospatial products from all of its WLCI activities to support (1) ranking and prioritizing of proposed conservation projects, (2) developing the WLCI Integrated Assessment, and (3) developing the WLCI 5-year Conservation Action Plan. Two activities were completed in FY2010: (1) the conceptual modeling and indicator selection for monitoring resource conditions across the WLCI region, and (2) the literature review on effects of oil and gas development in western regions of the United States, both of which are in the last stages of publication.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Southwest Wyoming's wildlife and habitat resources are increasingly affected by energy and urban/exurban development, climate change, and other key drivers of ecosystem change. To ensure that southwest Wyoming's wildlife populations and habitats persist in the face of development and other changes, a consortium of public resource-management agencies proposed the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI), the overall goal of which is to implement conservation actions. As the principal agency charged with conducting WLCI science, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has developed a Science Strategy for the WLCI. Workshops were held for all interested parties to identify and refine the most pressing management needs for achieving WLCI goals. Research approaches for addressing those needs include developing conceptual models for understanding ecosystem function, identifying key drivers of change affecting WLCI ecosystems, and conducting scientific monitoring and experimental studies to better understand ecosystems processes, cumulative effects of change, and effectiveness of habitat treatments. The management needs drive an iterative, three-phase framework developed for structuring and growing WLCI science efforts: Phase I entails synthesizing existing information to assess current conditions, determining what is already known about WLCI ecosystems, and providing a foundation for future work; Phase II entails conducting targeted research and monitoring to address gaps in data and knowledge during Phase I; and Phase III entails integrating new knowledge into WLCI activities and coordinating WLCI partners and collaborators. Throughout all three phases, information is managed and made accessible to interested parties and used to guide and improve management and conservation actions, future habitat treatments, best management practices, and other conservation activities.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) was launched in 2007 in response to concerns about threats to the State's world class wildlife resources, especially the threat posed by rapidly increasing energy development in southwest Wyoming. The overriding purpose of the WLCI is to assess and enhance aquatic and terrestrial habitats at a landscape scale, while facilitating responsible energy and other types of development. The WLCI includes partners from Federal, State, and local agencies, with participation from public and private entities, industry, and landowners. As a principal WLCI partner, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provides multidisciplinary scientific and technical support to inform decisionmaking in the WLCI. To address WLCI management needs, USGS has designed and implemented five integrated work activities: (1) Baseline Synthesis, (2) Targeted Monitoring and Research, (3) Integration and Coordination, (4) Data and Information Management, and (5) Decisionmaking and Evaluation. Ongoing information management of data and products acquired or generated through the integrated work activities will ensure that crucial scientific information is available to partners and stakeholders in a readily accessible and useable format for decisionmaking and evaluation. Significant progress towards WLCI goals has been achieved in many Science and Technical Assistance tasks of the work activities. Available data were identified, acquired, compiled, and integrated into a comprehensive database for use by WLCI partners and to support USGS science activities. A Web-based platform for sharing these data and products has been developed and is already in use. Numerous map products have been completed and made available to WLCI partners, and other products are in progress. Initial conceptual, habitat, and climate change models have been developed or refined. Monitoring designs for terrestrial and aquatic indicators have been completed, pilot data have been collected for terrestrial indicators, and evaluations of alternative monitoring designs are underway. Initial models and map products have been developed for assessing vegetation, surface disturbance, oil and gas resources, mineral resources, surficial geology, invasive species, aspen treatments, ungulate migration corridors, greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis), and songbirds, and data were collected or compiled to validate and refine the models. Coordination and collaboration among partners has led to the production of several documents addressing WLCI objectives, strategies, and guiding principles, and has facilitated implementation of on-the-ground habitat treatments.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Carbon County is located in the south-central part of Wyoming and is the third largest county in the State. A study to describe the physical and chemical characteristics of surface-water and ground-water resources in Carbon County was conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Wyoming State Engineer’s Office. Evaluations of streamflow and stream-water quality were limited to analyses of historical data and descriptions of previous investigations. Surface-water data were not collected as part of the study. Forty-five ground-water-quality samples were collected as part of the study and the results from an additional 618 historical ground-water-quality samples were reviewed. Available hydrogeologic characteristics for various aquifers in hydrogeologic units throughout the county also are described.\\n\\nFlow characteristics of streams in Carbon County vary substantially depending on regional and local basin char\\xadacteristics and anthropogenic factors. Precipitation in the county is variable with high mountainous areas receiving several times the annual precipitation of basin lowland areas. For this reason, streams with headwaters in mountainous areas generally are perennial, whereas most streams in the county with headwaters in basin lowland areas are ephemeral, flowing only as a result of regional or local rainfall or snowmelt runoff. Flow characteristics of most perennial streams are altered substantially by diversions and regulation.\\n\\nWater-quality characteristics of selected streams in and near Carbon County during water years 1966 through 1986 varied. Concentrations of dissolved constituents and suspended sediment were smallest at sites on streams with headwaters in mountainous areas because of resistant geologic units, large diluting streamflows, and increased vegetative cover compared to sites on streams with headwaters in basin lowlands.\\n\\nBoth water-table and artesian conditions occur in aquifers within the county. Shallow ground water is available throughout the county, although much of it is only marginally suitable or is unsuitable for domestic and irrigation uses mainly because of high total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations. Suitable ground water for livestock use is available in most areas of the county. Ground-water quality tends to deteriorate with increasing distance from recharge areas and with increasing depth below land surface. Ground water from depths greater than a few thousand feet tends to have TDS concentrations that make it moderately saline to briny. In some areas, even shallow ground water is moderately saline. Specific constituents in parts of some aquifers in the county occur in relatively high concentrations when compared to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency drinking-water standards; for example, relatively high concentrations of sulfate, chloride, fluoride, boron, iron, manganese, and radon were found in several aquifers.\\n\\nThe estimated mean daily water use in Carbon County in 2000 was about 320 million gallons per day. Water used for irrigation accounted for about 98 percent of this total. About 98 percent of the total water used was supplied by surface water and about 2 percent by ground water. Excluding irrigation, ground water comprised about 78 percent of total water use in Carbon County. Although ground water is used to a much lesser extent than surface water, in many areas of the county it is the only available water source.',\n",

The Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative is a long-term science-based effort to ensure southwestern Wyoming’s wildlife and habitat remain viable in areas facing development pressure.  Wyoming encompasses some of the highest quality wildlife habitats in the Intermountain West.  At the same time, this region is an important source of natural gas. Using Geographic Information System technology, energy data pertinent to the conservation decision-making process have been assembled to show historical oil and gas exploration and production in southwestern Wyoming. In addition to historical data, estimates of undiscovered oil and gas are included from the 2002 U.S. Geological Survey National Assessment of Oil and Gas in the Southwestern Wyoming Province. This report is meant to facilitate the integration of existing data with new knowledge and technologies to analyze energy resources development and to assist in habitat conservation planning. The well and assessment data can be accessed and shared among many different clients including, but not limited to, an online web-service for scientists and resource managers engaged in the Initiative.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Animals can require different habitat types throughout their annual cycles. When considering habitat prioritization, we need to explicitly consider habitat requirements throughout the annual cycle, particularly for species of conservation concern. Understanding annual habitat requirements begins with quantifying how far individuals move across landscapes between key life stages to access required habitats. We quantified individual interseasonal movements for greater sage‐grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter sage‐grouse) using radio‐telemetry spanning the majority of the species distribution in Wyoming. Sage‐grouse are currently a candidate for listing under the United States Endangered Species Act and Wyoming is predicted to remain a stronghold for the species. Sage‐grouse use distinct seasonal habitats throughout their annual cycle for breeding, brood rearing, and wintering. Average movement distances in Wyoming from nest sites to summer‐late brood‐rearing locations were 8.1\\u2009km (SE\\u2009=\\u20090.3\\u2009km; n\\u2009=\\u2009828 individuals) and the average subsequent distances moved from summer sites to winter locations were 17.3\\u2009km (SE\\u2009=\\u20090.5\\u2009km; n\\u2009=\\u2009607 individuals). Average nest‐to‐winter movements were 14.4\\u2009km (SE\\u2009=\\u20090.6\\u2009km; n\\u2009=\\u2009434 individuals). We documented remarkable variation in the extent of movement distances both within and among sites across Wyoming, with some individuals remaining year‐round in the same vicinity and others moving over 50\\u2009km between life stages. Our results suggest defining any of our populations as migratory or non‐migratory is innappropriate as individual strategies vary widely. We compared movement distances of birds marked using Global Positioning System (GPS) and very high frequency (VHF) radio marking techniques and found no evidence that the heavier GPS radios limited movement. Furthermore, we examined the capacity of the sage‐grouse core regions concept to capture seasonal locations. As expected, we found the core regions approach, which was developed based on lek data, was generally better at capturing the nesting locations than summer or winter locations. However, across Wyoming the sage‐grouse breeding core regions still contained a relatively high percentage of summer and winter locations and seem to be a reasonable surrogate for non‐breeding habitat when no other information exists. We suggest that conservation efforts for greater sage‐grouse implicitly incorporate seasonal habitat needs because of high variation in the amount of overlap among breeding core regions and non‐breeding habitat. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Salinization is a global threat to the quality of streams and rivers, but it can have many causes. Oil and gas development were investigated as one of several potential causes of changes in the salinity of Muddy Creek, which drains 2470 km2 of mostly public land in Wyoming, U.S.A. Stream discharge and salinity vary with seasonal snowmelt and define a primary salinity–discharge relationship. Salinity, measured by specific conductance, increased substantially in 2009 and was 53–71% higher at low discharge and 33–34% higher at high discharge for the years 2009–2012 compared to 2005–2008. Short-term processes (e.g., flushing of efflorescent salts) cause within-year deviations from the primary relation but do not obscure the overall increase in salinity. Dissolved elements associated with increased salinity include calcium, magnesium, and sulfate, a composition that points to native soil salts derived from marine shales as a likely source. Potential causes of the salinity increase were evaluated for consistency by using measured patterns in stream chemistry, slope of the salinity–discharge relationship, and inter-annual timing of the salinity increase. Potential causes that were inconsistent with one or more of those criteria included effects from precipitation, evapotranspiration, reservoirs, grazing, irrigation return flow, groundwater discharge, discharge of energy co-produced waters, and stream habitat restoration. In contrast, surface disturbance of naturally salt-rich soil by oil and gas development activities, such as pipeline, road, and well pad construction, is a reasonable candidate for explaining the salinity increase. As development continues to expand in semiarid lands worldwide, the potential for soil disturbance to increase stream salinity should be considered, particularly where soils host substantial quantities of native salts.',\n",

This book is the definitive synthesis of these epic journeys as seen through the eyes of the biologists and wildlife managers who have studied the ungulates, or hoofed mammals, of Wyoming.\\n\\nA century and a half ago, the push of western expansion persecuted these great herds, and some were lost. In the early twentieth century, a new ethic of wildlife conservation helped big game populations recover as the West was settled. Today many of these herds again roam Wyoming’s mountains and plains. Now for the first time, scientists armed with new satellite technology are discovering and describing ungulate migrations in detail never seen before.\\n\\nEach spread in this full color book investigates an ecological, historical, or conservation aspect of migration through clear and compelling maps, graphics, and photos. Using a narrative style that is both accessible and scientifically rigorous, this atlas tells the nuanced story of wildlife migration, the scientists who are studying it, and the conservationists who are working to keep wild migrations flowing across western landscapes. Wild Migrations is the perfect library addition for any reader interested in wildlife and landscapes of the American West, including hunters, students, biologists, land managers, decision-makers, and outdoor enthusiasts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Wyoming has experienced a significant increase in energy development over the last two decades. Oil and gas extraction is currently occurring throughout the southern extent of the Wyoming Range, and proposed expansion to the northern portion threatens to undermine the area’s ecological integrity and biodiversity. In the summer months of 2012 and 2013, we will assess the current and future effects of energy development on the fishes of the Wyoming Range. We hypothesize that the structure of fish assemblages relates to habitat conditions which may be altered by drilling practices and associated infrastructure. Ecological disturbances include but are not limited to: increased road densities and vehicle traffic; fragmentation of terrestrial and aquatic habitats; and pollution of air, water and soil. Large information gaps exist regarding the effects of these disturbances on aquatic ecosystems. By comparing fish assemblages, riparian condition, sedimentation rates, and water quality and quantity between active energy development sites and “undeveloped” sites we will evaluate the impacts of resource extraction on the fish communities of the Wyoming Range. “Undeveloped” sites will be chosen to intentionally include proposed drilling areas. This will benefit our study in two ways; first, it will allow us to forecast impacts related to oil and gas development in the future, and it will provide an excellent baseline data set for comparison post-drilling. Our overall goal is document current ecological impacts that are affecting fish assemblages as well as predict how future development will impact presently undisturbed areas.',\n",

We assessed the utility of riparian consumers as indicators of aquatically derived Se. We measured Se concentrations in soil, water, sediment, riparian spiders (Tetragnatha), and larval and adult damselflies (Lestidae and Coenagrionidae) at nine sites. Concentrations of Se in spiders and damselfly larvae exceeded levels safe for fish and wildlife consumption. Se concentrations in spiders increased significantly (p< 0.05) with increasing Se in water (R2 =0.77) and sediment (R2 =0.68). Se concentrations in damselfly larvae decreased with increasing Se in sediment (R2 =0.87) but increased with increasing Se in amphipods (R2 =0.93). Adult damselfly Se concentrations showed no trend with Se in larvae, soil, water, or sediment. Stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) did not discriminate between aquatic and terrestrial sources because terrestrially derived detritus dominated aquatic carbon. Se concentrations in emergent aquatic adults were higher than in terrestrial animals suggesting that exposure to Se was through emergent aquatic prey. We conclude Tetragnatha is an indicator of terrestrial exposure to aquatically derived Se.',\n",

A synoptic watershed assessment was conducted in 2010 to determine areas within the watershed that are more susceptible to mobilization of trace elements that occur in soils forming on marine shale. Soil, stream sediment, and water samples were collected and analyzed for major elements and a suite of trace elements. Formation waters discharged from two wells within the watershed were sampled in 2011 to evaluate the potential contribution to surface water organic carbon, nitrogen species, and trace elements. Soil nutrients were present in low concentrations throughout the watershed, with the exception of the headwater sampling site. Muddy Creek sediments were also nutrient-poor, with low concentrations of organic carbon (<0.05 to 1.4 % C) and no detectable concentrations of nitrogen. Selenium (Se), which was primarily derived from the weathering of exposed shale, increased in concentration with organic carbon in stream sediments and in alluvial soils. This correlation is consistent with the binding of Se to organic matter. Soils that formed directly from Se-bearing shales did not exhibit this relationship between Se and organic carbon. The ratio of dissolved organic carbon to total dissolved nitrogen was greater than 20 (DOC; 280 to 840 µM C; TDN; 12-40 µM N). Groundwater collected from two wells did not have unusually elevated Se or DOC concentrations, but did have elevated inorganic nitrogen concentrations (60 µM N-NH4 + in Well 1, 13 µM N-NO3 - in Well 2) relative to stream concentrations ((N-NH4 + + N-NO3 - ) < 4 µM N). The introduction of groundwater with DOC:TDN ratios 0.8 to 1.5, where N is dominantly inorganic, to streams where N is dominantly organic can potentially result in the shift of stream ecosystems and the type of organic matter present.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Resolving concerns regarding energy types, development, and a secure energy future are high priorities for the current administration with emphasized focus by the Department of Interior. Land management agencies within DOI, in particular the Bureau of Land Management, must contend with balancing energy development with other land uses and values. Such decisions are often controversial and complex, necessitating easy access to useful data, literature and on-line resources that facilitate better understanding of various effects from energy development. While there are several valuable on-line resources, these are spread across numerous websites and are often focused on only a few key components (e.g. oil and gas literature; wind energy and wildlife; etc.). Development of a web-based energy resource database comprised of pertinent foundational and current literature citations, links to relevant energy related on-line resources and research efforts would provide USGS researchers and collaborators an efficient mechanism to access the latest data and research references. Seeing the need for such an effort, the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative has funded the development of the Western Energy Citation Clearinghouse or WECC. The key objective of this effort is to develop a web based literature citation database of research that can be easily queried to serve as a “clearinghouse” of key literature and on-line resources for energy, energy development, and associated effects on the landscape. The database will be a ‘living’ database in that it will be continuously reviewed and updated in order to provide the most up-to-date resources. Through extensive collaboration across disciplines and thorough literature searches fundamental foundational and current literature to include in the database will be identified. Links to other useful literature databases and websites are also identified for easy access.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Increasing demand for a domestic energy supply has led to an increase in development impacts in areas rich in these resources. Development of continuous oil and gas accumulations (coalbed gas, tight gas, shale gas, shale oil) requires regularly spaced wells accompanying infrastructure over broad areas. The cumulative surface disturbance of such development has an impact on water and biological resources, but the severity and specifics of the impacts often vary with the landscape and oil and gas development style. To quantify the impacts of developing a given area in a manner that includes estimates of uncertainty, a probabilistic multidisciplinary approach is needed. Probabilistic modeling provides an approach for linking multidisciplinary aspects with energy and mineral assessments, and builds on an extensive existing dataset. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Assessment of Oil and Gas Resources Project produces assessments of the technically recoverable undiscovered oil and gas resources in priority sedimentary basins of the United States. The reports provide the necessary information to probabilistically model the potential energy development of an oil and/or gas accumulation. We propose to use this information, along with impact-related biologic and hydrologic data and documentation, in a Monte Carlo framework to estimate the potential impacts of future oil and gas development, and conversely, the impacts of restrictions on surface disturbance. While the approach will not generate spatially explicit maps detailing exact locations of roads and pads, it will output a set of probabilistic estimates of the impacts to a given area, as well as related spatial information.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Energy development has become a primary source of anthropogenic habitat alteration in the western US, with the majority of development occurring within sagebrush dominated landscapes. Previous research in the Upper Green River Basin, WY demonstrated decreased daily nest survival rates of the three sagebrush-obligate songbird species (Brewer’s sparrow, sagebrush sparrow and sage thrasher) with increased surrounding habitat loss due to natural gas development. This decreased nest success was due to increased predation, with three quarters of observed nest depredation events attributed to rodents. The objectives of our current study are to identify the relationship between songbird nest predation rates and small mammal abundance, and examine possible mechanisms driving the increased abundance of rodent nest predators. We are testing two main hypotheses to assess increases in rodent abundance surrounding natural gas development: 1) a mesopredator release hypothesis and 2) a food augmentation hypothesis. Data collection occurred from May-August 2015, and will continue in 2016. Nest monitoring, small mammal trapping, and mesopredator surveys were conducted across a gradient of habitat loss to address our first hypothesis, that predators for which rodents are a primary prey item may be less abundant near energy development. To address our second hypothesis, we assayed body condition of captured small mammals to assess whether reclaimed areas near well pads, which are primarily composed of native and non-native grasses and forbs rather than sagebrush, are providing supplemental food to rodents. Preliminary data suggest that songbird nest survival decreased with surrounding habitat loss, small mammals (deer mice and chipmunks) are consistently the main nest predators, and small mammal abundance was inversely related to nest survival. Identifying the drivers of nest predation in this system will improve understanding of how anthropogenic habitat change via energy development is affecting wildlife species of concern.',\n",

As part of the science and technical support effort for the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) we developed an integrated assessment to inform planning and decision-making in the WLCI area with a focus on informing habitat enhancement and conservation decisions. The assessment is an integrated analysis of WLCI priority resources based on the best available data and information. The integrated assessment includes priority resources (e.g., WLCI partner priority areas, water resources, special management areas), condition indices (e.g., based on distributions of species of concern, WLCI focal habitats), agents of change (e.g., energy and mineral development, roads, invasive plants, climate) and potential for future change associated with development and climate. The integrated assessment summarizes information by watershed into an overall index using a transparent and hierarchical framework. The framework is designed to allow users to decompose summary scores and evaluate individual resources. In addition to supporting landscape-scale conservation planning and evaluation, the integrated assessment is a data and information resource for addressing specific agency management questions. The integrated assessment and the supporting data used to build the assessment are currently available through a web application. A report detailing the work is in preparation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'U.S. Geological Survey researchers, in collaboration with academic and Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) partners, are using inexpensive, near-surface reflectance sensors to measure plant greenness, which is a measure of phenology (timing of life history events) and an indicator of productivity. Our goal is to provide resource managers with a tool for measuring and monitoring green-up, maximum greenness and senescence by plant species of interest. Plant green-up is one of the landscape changes a resource manager could monitor to improve decision making. For example, spring greenup can be used as an indicator of forage production, which affects seasonal habitat condition. However, knowing exactly when plants green-up in the spring is not easy. Satellite imagery may be used to calculate an index of greenness, such as the remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). But satellite-derived NDVI is limited. Weeks or months may pass without good satellite data, the spatial resolution may be too coarse, and in areas with complex topography or vegetation structure early greenup may not be detected. Ideally, resource managers would have access to more precise green-up data to facilitate decisions regarding elk feedgrounds, fuel production (fire hazard), and nonnative plant species control, for example. In addition, climate change models for the northern Rocky Mountains predict changes in temperature and water availability that in turn will alter vegetation. Changes could include timing of plant life history events, or phenology, such as green-up, flowering and senescence, and shifts in species composition. Changes in vegetation could make forage for ungulates, sage-grouse, and livestock available earlier in the growing season, but shifts in species composition and phenology may also result in earlier senescence and reduced overall forage production.',\n",

The development of baseline ecological data is critical to the success of this task. This paper describes the assessment of a WLCI focal habitat (aspen) in a WLCI Local Project Team Development Area (Little Mountain Ecosystem). A fine-scale map of aspen and conifer distribution in this area is needed because existing regional data sets were not designed to support decisions at localized scales. We employed Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis to map aspen and conifer communities using SPOT satellite imagery (10 meter resolution). We utilized multiple scenes that included summer imagery (aspen leaf-on) and autumn imagery (aspen leaf-off) to improve delineation of deciduous aspen trees from coniferous species such as subalpine fir and Douglas-fir. The information from this task can be used to aid management and effectiveness monitoring efforts and the methodology can be applied to other areas of the WLCI. Furthermore, this area was affected by a severe, multiyear drought in the early part of the decade. Aspen and conifer woodlands exist at the xeric fringes of their range in this important ecotone, but little is known about the impacts of drought on these communities. Resource managers are faced with increasing levels of uncertainty about future landscapes and recent disturbances afford the opportunity to study the impacts of such events that are predicted to increase in frequency over the next century. Remote sensing methodologies provide a cost effective way to monitor change in the woodlands of this area over the recent past. Furthermore, this effort provides spatially explicit information on both management treatments and natural disturbances such as wildfire, severe drought, and insect related tree mortality.',\n",

A goal of the MT is to compile detailed information on monitoring efforts in a centrally-located accessible format for use as a reference tool to help inform monitoring by local project teams and others. Additionally, a goal is to develop integrated approaches for coordinated monitoring across agencies and the WLCI landscape. Team members from multiple agencies and affiliations have identified previous and ongoing monitoring efforts of value for assessing the status and long-term trends in resource conditions across the region. Because of the potentially large number of contributions (a preliminary compilation of records documents more than 100 projects and/or datasets from 8 different agencies), and the need for timely results, we have prioritized current efforts to focus on data and methods relating to important wildlife, Federally listed or pending T&E species, distribution and condition of terrestrial, wetland and aquatic habitats, vegetation and ecosystem structure and function, hydrologic function, soil conditions, and effects of restoration and other management actions. Acquired information is recorded in a database designed to facilitate information assessment and sharing, as demonstrated by a case study of rangeland monitoring within the Rock Springs Field Office. Initial discussions with rangeland conservation specialists consisted of information acquisition and record documentation. A comparison of existing methods identified opportunities to develop consistency and coordination. A consensus was reached resulting in designated protocols and common methods for future implementation across the Field Office area. These protocols identify a means to collect, analyze and store data in a manner that is consistent over a large spatial and temporal extent. In this presentation we provide an overview of the MT effort, and recent assessments of acquired information related to rangeland monitoring in SW Wyoming.',\n",

Object-oriented software programs such as Trimble’s eCognition® and Overwatch’s Feature Analyst® have been employed to extract pad information from satellite imagery of varying resolutions. These approaches required considerable time investments given the need to adjust rule sets and extraction parameters to produce moderately acceptable results for this semi-arid environment, and the level of clean-up required to correct the amount of commission and omission errors. We developed an approach to extract surface disturbance of pads from 1-m, 4-band NAIP imagery acquired in 2009 that provides reasonable representation of surface disturbance of pads while minimizing cleanup requirements. This procedure employs a hierarchy of Classification and Regression Tree models that uses spectral values to identify pad areas, and additional rule-sets related to shape and size. Models and rule sets were developed using digitized pads and other infrastructure from a high-density energy field in southwest Wyoming. Our procedures result in polygons that approximate surface disturbance due to pads, and have reduced ‘clutter’ compared to previous methods. Manual clean-up is still required to correct commission and omission errors and to enhance pad boundaries; however, clean-up requirements are generally less extensive than required with previous methods. We have used our approach to extract pads from the 2,213 NAIP images that cover the WLCI and have completed manual cleanup of 931 images, which represent 57 percent of the WLCI’s 19 million acres.',\n",

The dominating influence of noxious, invasive plants, including cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), desert alyssum (Alyssum desertorum), and halogeton (Halogeton glomeratus) represents a critical threat to quality wildlife habitats and livestock forage. As the landscape changes, opportunities for weeds on public and private, managed, and native systems continue to be created. Our research has identified several important predictors of weed distributions, including geology, surface hydrology and land-use patterns. This understanding can help inform current planning and management decisions, and can be used to structure future research. In addition, we used statistical relationships between environmental variables and weed occurrence to map the potential distribution of several species. We will present a summary of the development process, mapped distribution models for several species of concern, and a discussion of the “best” predictors of weed distributions as demonstrated by our data. Based on understanding of potential distributions and environmental correlations, these projections can inform strategic planning for weed control at regional and local scales. Importantly, these approaches can be used for native and invasive species, different sized regions, and compiled data, with new observations easily incorporated for model revision, offering a potentially important tool for increasing the benefits of rapid assessments and population surveys.',\n",

The county has undergone recent land use change in the form of heightened rural residential development on private land and increased energy development on both public and private land. The population of Sublette County nearly doubled over the last 25 years and is expected to grow by 50 percent by 2030. We are interested in understanding recent patterns of rural residential development (i.e. areas outside of town boundaries); a phenomenon that is rarely analyzed in a spatially explicit manner. The primary mechanism of land use change on portions of public land in the county is due to energy development. The Jonah and Pinedale Anticline Natural Gas Fields have each had an exponential increase in the number of wells drilled since the late-1990s. Additional wells require infrastructure such as well pads, roads and pipelines that creates a disturbance on the landscape. We sought to understand the relationship between the number of wells at each field and the size of the disturbance. In this study we integrate energy production data, population census data, ownership parcel data, and landscape metrics derived from a series of Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper scenes (over a 25 year period) to create a map that illustrates the changing landscape. Sublette County has a wealth of wildlife and associated habitat which is affected by both types of growth. While we do not attempt to quantify the effect of disturbance on wildlife species, we believe our results provide important baseline data that can be incorporated into land use planning and ecological-wildlife research at the landscape scale.',\n",

Data collected by Earth observing satellites can be used to measure biophysical and phenological characteristics of vegetation at multiple spatiotemporal scales and extents. The Landsat satellite series is the most widely used platform for investigating changes in land cover and land use; however, a 16-day return interval often limits its ability to monitor dynamic conditions. Other sensors, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), have a revisit cycle of 1-2 days, but lack the spatial resolution often needed to evaluate habitat responses to treatments. The Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) seeks to alleviate these limitations and could assist with monitoring seasonal and interannual changes in plant phenology and biomassacross broadspatial extents at fine spatiotemporal scales. STARFM uses date-paired MODIS/Landsat image sets to create synthetic Landsat images when MODIS data are available but Landsat data are lacking. STARFM has successfully predicted surface reflectance values across homogeneous landscapes, but has not been applied to the heterogeneous shrub-steppe dominated habitats of southwest Wyoming. We evaluated STARFM’s ability to predict surface reflectance and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values for several land cover/ land use types common in the WLCI area. Reflectance and NDVI values were successfully predicted across the study area. Estimates correlated well with measured values and were reasonably accurate and unbiased. The strength of these relationships decreased as the lag between input and prediction dates increased. Performance also varied among land cover/ land use types. Synthetic reflectance and NDVI data should be useful to land managers seeking to monitor intra- and interannual changes in plant biomass or phenology associated with vegetation treatments.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter GRSG) has been a focus of scientific investigation and management action for the past two decades. The 2015 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listing determination of “not warranted” was in part due to a large-scale collaborative effort to develop strategies to conserve GRSG populations and their habitat and to reduce threats to both. New scientific information augments existing knowledge and can help inform updates or modifications to existing plans for managing GRSG and sagebrush ecosystems. However, the sheer number of scientific publications can be a challenge for managers tasked with evaluating and determining the need for potential updates to existing planning documents. To assist in this process, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has reviewed and summarized the scientific literature published since January 1, 2015.\\n\\nTo identify articles and reports published about GRSG, we first conducted a structured search of three reference databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) using the search term “greater sage-grouse.” We refined the initial list of products by (1) removing duplicates, (2) excluding products that were not published as research or scientific review articles in peer-reviewed journals or as formal government technical reports, and (3) retaining only those products for which GRSG or their habitat was a research focus.\\n\\nWe summarized the contents of each product by using a consistent structure (background, objectives, methods, location, findings, and implications) and assessed the content of each product relevant to a list of 31 management topics. These topics include GRSG biology and habitat characteristics along with potential management actions, land uses, and environmental factors related to GRSG management and conservation. We also noted which articles/reports created new geospatial data.\\n\\nThe final search was conducted on January 6, 2018, and application of our criteria resulted in the inclusion of 169 published products (2 of these products were published corrections to journal articles). The management topics most commonly addressed were GRSG behavior or demographics and GRSG habitat selection or habitat characteristics at broad or site scales. Few products addressed captive breeding, recreation, wild horses and burros, and range management structures (including fences). We include in this annotated bibliography the full citation, product summary, and management topics addressed by each product. The online version of this bibliography (https://apps.usgs.gov/gsgbib/index.php) is searchable by topic and location and includes links to the original publications.\\n\\nA substantial body of literature has been compiled based on research explicitly related to the conservation, management, monitoring, and assessment of GRSG. These studies may inform planning and management actions that seek to balance conservation, economic, and social objectives and manage diverse resource uses and values across the western United States.\\n\\nThe review process for this product included requesting input on each summary from one or more authors of the original peer-reviewed article or report and a formal review of the entire document by three independent reviewers and, subsequently, the USGS Bureau Approving Official. This process is consistent with USGS Fundamental Science Practices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Oil and gas development can affect aquatic ecosystems through water contamination, water use, and surface disturbance from infrastructure development (roads, pipelines, well pads, etc.). We examined how oil and gas development can affect water quality, habitat quality, and fish communities in the Upper Green River Drainage. We used multiple approaches to assess water quality and found several potential avenues of degradation. Surface disturbance likely contributed to elevated suspended sediment concentrations; spill history likely led to elevated stream polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations; and degraded drainage and riparian health likely contributed to greater temperature and discharge fluctuations in disturbed streams. We found that streams within the developed drainages had degraded ecological conditions, as indicated by the lack of sensitive macroinvertebrates, less willow cover along stream banks, predominantly run habitat, and increased proportions of fine sediment. In contrast, reference streams had consistently good water quality, sensitive macroinvertebrates, more riparian vegetation, more pool and riffle habitat, and higher proportions of gravel. Fish showed differential sensitivity to oil and gas disturbance. Colorado River cutthroat trout were only found in the reference streams, and in these streams mottled sculpin were found in higher abundance. In contrast, mountain suckers appeared to be habitat generalists and were able to persist in a wide range of conditions, including degraded sites in areas with high levels of energy development. The aquatic ecosystem impairment we documented in streams running through the Labarge Oil and Gas Field exemplifies the need for site specific research and mitigation strategies, to ensure that energy development does not compromise important ecological conditions and services.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Riparian forests provide rare and valuable features in landscapes that are generally too dry for trees. Consequently they are often a focal point for the consideration of environmental impacts of development and management activities as well as a target of restoration effort. In some senses these are simple ecosystems – a small number of important woody species, strong and distinctive spatial and temporal patterns, and dominance of single physical factor (streamflow-determined moisture) in determining structure and behavior. In practical application, however, that simplicity is complicated by the mediating role of specific geomorphic setting, the importance of infrequent events, the persistent signature of long-past events, important disturbance-dependent species, effects of herbivory, changes in the regional species pool, and a tendency for these systems to be in a state of transition frequently far from any single, long-term steady state. Emphasizing examples from applied studies by riparian ecologists at the Fort Collins Science Center of the US Geological Survey, I review the life history characteristics and autecology of selected plains riparian trees, the principal factors determining the structure and dynamics of these plains riparian forests, some of the distinctive responses to human alteration that have been observed, and some of the conceptual and analytical tools to inform impact assessment and restoration.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Muddy Creek watershed in southwest Wyoming has ongoing conventional and coalbed natural gas development. In response to concerns about effects of energy development on water resources, the U.S. Geological Survey has been sampling the water quality of Muddy Creek since 2006. Sampling has included fixed-site sampling at Muddy Creek stream-gaging stations to characterize seasonal and annual variability of major ions, selenium, and other trace elements. In addition, multi-discipline synoptic studies were conducted during 2010 and 2011 to characterize occurrence and distribution of these constituents in surface water, groundwater, soil, bed sediment, and aquatic and riparian insect samples in order to evaluate watershed processes. Water chemistry of the Muddy Creek watershed varies temporally and spatially. Total dissolved solids in Muddy Creek generally were inversely related to streamflow and ranged from 267 to 2,810 milligrams per liter during 2006–11. Selenium concentrations in Muddy Creek occasionally exceeded aquatic-life criteria and generally were largest during low-flow conditions. Results from the 2010 synoptic study indicated calcium and bicarbonate dominated the chemistry of Muddy Creek in the upper basin. In contrast, sodium and sulfate dominated the chemistry in the lower basin, in part due to differences in geology. Eastern tributaries to Muddy Creek generally were mixed magnesium, sodium, sulfate, and bicarbonate waters. Groundwater chemistry of flowing wells sampled during the 2011 synoptic study were dominated by sodium and bicarbonate, and generally had larger concentrations of trace elements that are more soluble under reduced conditions (such as barium and iron) compared to stream samples. In contrast, concentrations of other trace elements (such as arsenic and selenium) tended to be larger in stream samples compared to groundwater. Overall, results suggest that the dissolution of mineral salts at or near the surface is an important process controlling the stream chemistry in the Muddy Creek watershed.',\n",

In response, Wyoming’s Executive Order for Sage-grouse (SGEO) implemented the Wyoming Sage-Grouse Core Area Protection policy in 2008 as a voluntary regulatory mechanism to minimize anthropogenic disturbance within defined sage-grouse core population areas. Our objectives were to evaluate the influence of the SGEO policy on: 1) oil and gas well pad development, and 2) peak male lek attendance in core and non-core sage-grouse populations. We conducted our evaluations at the statewide and Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies management zone (MZ I and MZ II) scales. We used ANCOVA modeling to evaluate change in well pad development from 1986–2014 and peak male lek attendance from 958 leks with consistent lek counts within increasing (1996–2006) and decreasing (2006–2013) timeframes for core and non-core sage-grouse populations. Oil and gas well pad development was restricted in core areas. Trends in peak male sage-grouse lek attendance were greater in core areas compared to non-core areas at the statewide scale and in MZ II, but not in MZ I, during the period of increase. Trends in total male lek attendance did not differ between core and non-core population areas statewide, in MZ I, or MZ II during the period of decrease. Our results provide support for the effectiveness of the Wyoming SGEO policy in maintaining sage-grouse populations, but also indicate the need for restorative actions to increase sage-grouse populations in MZ I.',\n",

Sustainability of traditional flood-irrigated rangeland and the biologically rich habitats they provide is at risk as pressure increases on the current water system to meet increasing domestic and industrial demands. Using a statistically valid, field based approach, we modeled wetland conditions and wildlife habitat value for three Wyoming basins. We found that levels of anthropogenic disturbance and hydrologic modification varied across basins as well as among differing wetland types. We piloted a tool to measure predicted avian richness and habitat suitability for sampled wetlands. Major changes in land use, irrigation practices, and on-going climate change will likely have widespread implications to wetlands. For example, in the Upper Green river basin results suggest that 40% of wet meadow wetlands are created or supported by irrigation; conversion to pivot irrigation could potentially affect an estimated 50,000 wetland acres and the wildlife habitat they provide. Our results have relevance for gaining a more holistic understanding of wetland systems that relates current patterns of disturbance and hydrologic modification to habitat value for wildlife. These results will support better decision-making for wetland enhancement, conservation, and restoration.',\n",

The Rocky Mountain Amphibian Project (RMAP) monitors amphibians by coordinating annual standardized surveys in predefined areas (catchments) on Forest Service lands in southern and western Wyoming and northern Colorado. The monitoring initiative began in 2012 and has expanded to include over 350 wetland sites in 70 catchments. In order to make the project sustainable, we began involving citizen scientists in 2014 to augment surveys conducted by biologists and technicians. Partners now include the Wyoming Natural Diversity Database, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, UW Biodiversity Institute, Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests, Bridger-Teton National Forest, Wyoming Geographic Information Science Center, The Nature Conservancy, Trout Unlimited, USGS Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative (ARMI), and Boy Scouts of America. The RMAP study design incorporates USGS ARMI guidelines for their mid-level occupancy-based modeling approach and methods closely resemble those used in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. Surveys follow standardized protocols designed to accommodate estimation of species detection probabilities. Biologists and citizen scientists either attend trainings or watch training videos before conducting surveys. Volunteer commitment and data quality has been excellent. In 2014, 78 volunteers conducted 174 surveys at 95 wetland sites across 18 catchments and hiked over 273 miles of mountainous terrain. We present preliminary results from 4 years of amphibian monitoring. We also compare the probability of detecting species and the quality and completeness of survey data collected by volunteers and by biologists and technicians. Assistance from trained citizen scientists will allow resource managers to collect data annually from a sufficient number of areas to track amphibian occupancy across large landscapes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Long-lived herbivores possess a conservative life-history strategy, wherein individuals seek to conserve their own survival at the cost of current reproduction. Age is a key life-history characteristic that has important effects on the behavior and performance of individuals, from influencing behavioral decisions, reproduction and reproductive effort, survival and mortality rate, and fat accretion and catabolism, among other key components. With little doubt, data on age of individual animals or age structure of populations is important for both research and management. To incorporate age as a covariate, some researchers have employed techniques to age individuals based on toothwear and replacement, which in general is more subjective and less accurate than cementum annuli but can be done without tooth extraction. To provide a more accurate estimate, in the late 90s, researchers began extracting a canine or incisiform canine from study animals. The consideration of whether to extract a tooth from ungulates for research and monitoring was debated in the literature over a decade ago. Since that time, methods have been modified, strategies to mitigate pain have been refined, and products to aid in achieving hemostasis have been developed. The primary consideration at this point is whether a tooth should be extracted, because the methods have been effectively worked out, and no resulting consequences of the extraction observed. What remains is an ethical question: “is the cost of tooth extraction to the individual worth the gain in knowledge for the study, population, or species in question?” Through a literature review and posthoc analyses of available data from longitudinal captures of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), I evaluate the current evidence as to the effects of tooth extraction and discuss the ethical aspects associated with tooth extraction in ungulates.',\n",

Glaciers and other frozen “assets” have supplied 75% of water for the western United States. Nonetheless, annual April snowpack measurements taken between 1956 and 2014 document decreasing water yield from about 80% of western mountains. Frozen-storage losses could be mitigated by liquid storage in wetlands, marshes, beaver ponds, peat beds, and other riparian features. However these wetlands, in order to retain or increase water yield, must be in proper functioning condition. A majority of BLM-managed wetlands in the lower 48 states are not in proper functioning condition. We review data collected from public-land riparian systems to illustrate what has been lost. We also review successes in restoring riparian function. These successes have required 20 or more years to implement for a variety of reasons. Land management agency action to regain or protect proper functioning riparian systems has been and will continue to be successful. Under expected climate-change scenarios, worsening West- wide water shortages are likely to continue unless the liquid-water storage capacity of the region can be restored.',\n",

This report outlined goals and recommendations to further improve avian monitoring programs including: using more rigorous statistical methodology, integrating monitoring programs, and making data and results widely accessible to land managers and the public. The Bird Conservancy of the Rockies (formerly the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory), with the help of numerous partners, has developed and implemented an avian monitoring program spanning all or portions of 13 states named Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions (IMBCR). The IMBCR program is well suited to address conservation issues and data needs identified by NABCI in their 2007 report including (1) determine status and trends; (2) inform management and policies to achieve conservation; (3) determine causes of population change; (4) evaluate conservation efforts; (5) set population objectives and priorities; and (6) inform conservation design. Continued monitoring under the IMBCR program will allow managers to detect trends in density and occupancy estimates over time as well as provide the raw data needed to develop tools to inform management on what to do and where to do it. Information gathered through the IMBCR program is made accessible to program partners and the public through the Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center (RMADC); a high quality, internet-accessible database.

       "  'abstract': 'Defining and understanding animal-habitat relationships is a fundamental concept in ecology and important to the implementation of conservation practices. Habitat relationships are often described for animal species during a single life stage and within a single region. However, animals typically require different habitats throughout their annual cycles and relationships may vary across landscapes. Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus hereafter sage-grouse) have been extirpated from nearly half of their original range in western North America, and Wyoming is predicted to remain one of the strongholds for populations. Sage-grouse require an adequate amount, configuration, and juxtaposition of all seasonal habitats for populations to persist. We developed state-wide seasonally explicit habitat selection models to help identify and delineate suitable seasonal habitats. We also quantified regional variation in habitat selection behavior. We compiled extensive radio-telemetry data from 11 sites across Wyoming (n = 3,000 individuals). We used these telemetry data, in combination with high-quality GIS data, to develop seasonal habitat selection models for sage-grouse across Wyoming. We developed models at patch and landscape extents for three separate life stages: 1) nesting, 2) summer/late brood-rearing, and 3) winter habitat. The statewide models performed well; however, we also assessed regional variation in habitat selection behaviour. We divided Wyoming into three regions and developed all seasonal models on a regional basis. We quantified variation in model form and the strength of selection for certain habitat components. Furthermore, we quantified the variation in model accuracy and precision between the state-wide and regional models to assess the value added by the regional approach.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata wyomingensis) has been historically treated through chemical application, mechanical treatments, and prescribed burning to increase amount and quality of herbaceous forage. Treatments are generally intended to rejuvenate sagebrush stands by killing older sagebrush plants to promote growth of younger sagebrush plants and increase resources for herbaceous production. However, information regarding greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) response to treatments is limited. Identification of specific habitat treatments that promote positive, negative, or neutral sage-grouse demographic response is necessary to evaluate the utility of sagebrush habitat treatments for sage-grouse and other co-occurring wildlife species. Our Before-After Impact-Control study began in the spring of 2011. Pre-treatment data collection continued through 2013 until mowing and Spike 20P treatments were applied in the winter and spring of 2014, respectively. Post-treatment data collection began in spring 2014 and will include up to 5 years. Our study is primarily designed to evaluate sage-grouse nesting success, brood survival, and adult female survival in response to mowing and herbicide treatments in central Wyoming. In addition, we are also evaluating: 1) nutritional quality of treated Wyoming big sagebrush, 2) dietary resources used by chick sage-grouse in treated and untreated areas, and 3) habitat selection patterns of grouse exposed to treatments. Our study uses data collected from approximately 100 radio-marked female sage-grouse that use 6 study areas each year. There are 2 study areas each that were mowed, aerially applied with Spike 20P, or serve as untreated controls. In our poster, we report preliminary findings associated with habitat selection and demographic responses from 2011 through 2015.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Modeling habitat selection is critical to inform conservation efforts for wildlife populations that winter in areas undergoing energy development. We compared winter habitat selection patterns for female greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) inhabiting a 6,979 km2 study area with coalbed natural gas (CBNG) extraction that straddled northwestern Colorado and south-central Wyoming, USA and a 1,546 km2 reference study area lacking energy development in south-central Wyoming, USA. Our objectives were to: 1) identify landscape characteristics that influenced winter habitat selection and 2) evaluate whether CBNG infrastructure influenced selection. We used 1,025 locations from radio-marked birds obtained from 34 fixed-wing flights across 3 winters (2007–2008, 2008–2009, and 2009–2010) in binary logistic regression modeling to quantify selection by comparing grouse and available locations at 3 spatial scales (490 m, 1,226 m, and 2,451 m radii) based on location error and 7 and 14 day movements, respectively. We used 13 landscape predictor variables including anthropogenic infrastructure, snow accumulation, topography, and vegetation in our analysis. Environmental variables that influenced grouse habitat selection in the CBNG study area included greater variability in shrub height and lesser variability in sagebrush cover within 2,451 m, areas with greater sagebrush cover within 1,226 m, and areas with lesser topographic ruggedness and greater topographic wetness within 490 m compared to random locations. Anthropogenic variables influencing winter grouse habitat selection in the CBNG study area included road effects within 2,451 m compared to random locations. Grouse in our reference study area selected winter habitat with lower topographic ruggedness within 490 m and greater sagebrush cover and lesser variability in sagebrush cover within 2,451 m compared to random locations. Our results indicate the importance of conserving large sagebrush landscapes for wintering sage-grouse that are characterized by low-to-moderate relief, variable shrub height, high sagebrush cover, and in areas with few roads.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Wind energy development is increasing in rangeland habitats, which has raised concerns relative to impacts to avian species including the Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter sage- grouse). Little information exists about the impacts of wind energy development on sage-grouse; however, wind energy infrastructure is likely to directly and indirectly impact sage-grouse movements because they avoid tall structures and human activities. Changing movements may equate to different habitat selection patterns, which are predicted to lead to reduced population fitness. The purpose of our study was to document habitat occurrence and fitness parameters associated with sage-grouse inhabiting areas in close proximity to wind turbines. In April 2009 and 2010, we captured 116 female sage-grouse near Medicine Bow, Wyoming and have monitored these grouse for 2 years to evaluate nest, brood, and female survival, and habitat occurrence. We used logistic regression to develop resource selection functions to estimate habitat occurrence. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to model nest, brood and female survival. The proximity to wind turbines did not influence nest site or brood-rearing occurrence but the relative probability of summer occurrence increased in habitats closer to wind turbines. Female survival was not influenced by wind turbines but nest and brood survival were both negatively affected by proximity to wind turbines. This is the first study to evaluate short-term effects of wind energy infrastructure--specifically wind turbines--on sage-grouse fitness parameters and habitat selection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Burrowing Owls are a species of conservation concern across the western United States and western Canada; large-scale survey efforts suggest that populations have declined across this region since the mid-1960s. Burrowing Owls present a unique challenge to managers applying standard on-site mitigation restrictions to natural gas developments (e.g., No Surface Occupancy and timing limitations around active raptor nests) because of year-to-year inconsistency in the locations of nesting territories selected by the species. In the Jonah II project area, drilling schedules developed by industry have often been disrupted by the presence of Burrowing Owls located during individual well clearance surveys. The overall goal of this proposed project is to develop habitat selection models capable of predicting locations of nesting Burrowing Owls in the subsequent year given conditions measured in the current year. These predictions could be used to reduce energy development conflicts with Burrowing Owls and subsequently reduce disruptions and interruptions to drilling schedules. Unlike most other raptors within SW Wyoming that nest on relatively unique, permanent substrates (i.e., cliffs, trees and outcrops), Burrowing Owls nest in holes dug by fossorial mammals; these sites are ephemeral with a limited life-span. Further, most of the extant information on Burrowing Owls is from areas where the species maintains a close association with black-tailed prairie dogs. The level of Burrowing Owl association with white-tailed prairie dogs--the species occurring within the WLCI area--is unknown. Differences in the biology of black-tailed vs. whitetailed prairie dogs and their habitats result in Burrowing Owls not being restricted to defined and mapped prairie dog towns in SW Wyoming. The pattern of extant data for the NPL and Jonah II project areas supports the thesis that suitable habitat associations for Burrowing Owls in SW Wyoming are provided by a variety of fossorial animal species in addition to prairie dogs; 48% (45/94) of all records from this area in the BLM database were not associated with mapped prairie dog towns. This lack of association biases the effectiveness of current surveys and potential mitigation considerations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The increasing realization that large-scale patterns and processes influence the functioning of wildlife habitat, has led many researchers and conservation practitioners to set conservation targets that explicitly incorporate landscape-level metrics. However, landscape-scale conservation policy presents a myriad of challenges for land managers. A science-based approach to conservation ensures transparency across stakeholders, quantification of effectiveness through rigorous monitoring, and adaptation of strategies depending on project outcomes and changing environmental conditions. An example of a species for which there is significant concern about its viability and commensurate conservation action is the Greater sage-grouse a species that ranges across sagebrush-steppe habitats of western North America including 11 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces. Concern for the long-term population viability of the species is due in part to continued contraction of their historical range and declining populations. We investigated sage-grouse trends using counts of males on leks from 2006 to 2013, and related these trends to landscape-scale changes in biological and anthropogenic variables across core areas in Wyoming. Annual estimates of male abundance were used to categorize the functionality of the landscape for sage-grouse through time according to predicted lek size and trend. We used the results of these investigations to evaluate spatial and temporal changes in the landscape-scale integrity of habitats designated as ‘core’ in Wyoming. The process initiated here provides a framework for relating changes in landscape conditions to sage-grouse population abundance for iteratively assessing the efficacy of conservation actions.',\n",

Pygmy rabbits –a Wyoming Species of Greatest Conservation Need– may be more heavily impacted by energy development in southwestern Wyoming than anywhere else in their occupied range, but little information exists on the relationship between gas field development and pygmy rabbits. To address this need, we began two studies to examine the relationship between gas field development and pygmy rabbit site occupancy patterns. The first is on the Normally Pressurized Lance (NPL) gas field in Sublette County, which is scheduled for development beginning in 2014, and may have up to 3,500 gas wells operational in a 220 mi2 area by 2024. In 2010, we began conducting pre-development site occupancy surveys for pygmy rabbits at 150 plots distributed evenly across the NPL and three adjacent control areas using a Before – After – Control – Impact (B-A-C-I) design. Power analysis indicates that our design is sufficient to detect a 35% change in occupancy in control versus NPL after development. Second, in 2011 we began evaluating the influence of gas field development density on pygmy rabbit site occupancy rates on the Atlantic Rim, Jonah, and PAPA gas fields. Using digital gas well data, NAIP imagery, and the WYNDD pygmy rabbit habitat map in Arc/Info, we located ≥26 survey plots in suitable pygmy rabbit habitat on each gas field, where plots spanned a gradient of gas well density ranging from zero to the maximum density present. We surveyed each plot for pygmy rabbit sign twice during summer of 2011, and are modeling plot occupancy status as a function of gas well, well pad, and road density. Occupancy trends based on year one of data collection will be presented. Over two additional years of sampling, we will attempt to identify development density thresholds above which pygmy rabbit site occupancy rates are adversely affected.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As habitat loss and fragmentation increase across ungulate ranges, identifying and prioritizing migration routes for land-use planning and conservation has taken on a new urgency. The Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit has been partially funded by WLCI to conduct research on the influence of energy development on mule deer, including their seasonal migrations. In an initial phase of this work, we created a general framework to map and identify migration routes with the highest conservation value within a route network. This approach has been applied to migratory mule deer populations that winter near the Atlantic Rim and Pinedale Anticline Project Areas. In addition to identifying key migration corridors for conservation and enhancement, these analyses identified the consistent use of stopover areas by migrating deer, similar to what has been found in long-distance migrations of avian taxa. In a second study, we found that mule deer migrating through undisturbed habitat spent considerable time (95% of their 3-week long migrations) stopping over to forage in identified habitat patches. This work suggests that migrating ungulates derive considerable foraging benefit from the habitats through which they migrate. Our research program has clarified the benefits that deer receive from migrating and will allow a more accurate characterization of the influence of energy development on these seasonal movements. In addition to this research overview, future management and research needs will be discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Identifying and prioritizing habitats that are important for conserving species is a challenging task, particularly for those with fluctuating populations and spatially and temporally differing habitat needs such as the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in Wyoming. To assess the long-term use of sage-grouse habitat and occupancy of core areas, we developed a spatially explicit individual-based model informed by lek counts, habitat selection maps, life history information, population dynamics, movement and behavior (i.e., nest site fidelities). Using a range of possible population trajectories, we quantified the contribution of areas inside and outside of protected core areas to population abundance. We also compared characterizations of important habitats generated from habitat selection (resource selection function) models with simulated habitat use influenced by population dynamics. Although the majority of birds occupy protected core areas during nesting, summer, and winter (up to 77, 77, and 71% respectively), occupancy depended in part on the season and population size, with a higher proportion of birds occupying cores during population downturns. When we simulated avoidance of areas outside of cores due to habitat loss and degradation, disproportionate population declines (up to ~ 45% of the population) indicated that non-core areas are likely to be important for accessing complementary habitats among seasons and locating and providing under-used habitats during population peaks. Explicit consideration of movement and population dynamics yielded habitat use predictions that emphasized the importance of high density, central, and accessible habitats that coincided or were near other seasonal habitats, particularly for summer and winter seasons. In contrast, habitat selection surfaces over-valued peripheral and isolated areas and those without overlap or linkages to other seasonal habitats. The addition of habitat selection, population dynamics and movement considerations may provide valuable insights into future assessments or prioritizations of important sage-grouse habitat, and should help with conservation and restoration planning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Our studies aimed to delineate summer and winter concentration areas for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter, sage-grouse), during 2008–2015. In our first study, we evaluated overlap of summer and winter concentration areas within 8 current Wyoming Sagegrouse Core Areas. To delineate seasonal concentration areas, we constructed kernel density contours (75% and 95%) using 7,692 summer and 1,488 winter sage-grouse locations from 5 distinct study areas. We compared the proportion of sage-grouse seasonal concentration areas that were within or outside of Core Areas. The proportion of summer concentration areas that overlapped with Core Areas was substantial with 0.69 of summer areas within a Core Area; whereas, 0.50 of winter concentration areas were within Core Areas. Ratios of individual summer to winter concentration area overlap indicated high variability (range of 0.94 to 3.67) in protection provided by Core Areas for winter concentration areas. In our second study, we used 44,000 winter locations obtained from 72 GPS-collared female sage-grouse across 2 study areas within 5 Core Areas to evaluate winter habitat selection. Resource selection functions indicated sage-grouse were selecting habitats in response to shrub characteristics, topography, and roads. Across studies, we found that generalizing winter habitat selection across study areas was inappropriate and selection should be assessed on a regional basis. Land use decisions used to construct Core Area boundaries resulted in removing some areas used by female sage-grouse in the winter from Core Area protection. The size and shape of constrained Core Areas relative to available sage-grouse breeding habitat in these areas resulted in more grouse locations falling outside Core Area protection during the breeding (15 Mar to 30 Jun) and winter (1 Dec to 15 Mar) seasons. This suggests seasonal use restrictions and other means to avoid impacts should be afforded to areas of winter concentration outside designated Core Areas.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Wyoming Core Area policy for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter, sage-grouse) limits infrastructure development within areas of high sage-grouse population densities. Management of Core Areas mainly focuses on limiting surface disturbance as a proxy to regulate landscape change, regardless of type (e.g., natural gas, exurban development, prescribed fire). We are evaluating implications of the 5% surface disturbance maximum, the disturbance cap set by the Wyoming Core Area policy, on sage-grouse nest and brood productivity and sage-grouse female habitat use during these critical life-stages. Our analysis focuses on surface disturbance that have been quantified by explicitly following Density and Disturbance Calculation Tool (DDCT) methodology. To explore these relationships we are using nest locations (n = 1049) and brood rearing locations (n = 2726; locations from VHF and GPS-marked females) compiled from 6 distinct study areas across Wyoming including Atlantic Rim and Stewart Creek (2008-2011), Southwest (2008-2011), Seven Mile Hill/Simpson Ridge (2009-2010), Jeffrey City (2011-2013), and Powder River Basin, Wyoming (2008-2011). Consequently, our sample of female sage-grouse were exposed to a variety of different landscapes and development types throughout Wyoming from natural gas (e.g., CBNG), conventional oil and gas development, wind farm development, to landscapes with very little human habitat-alteration. We will be presenting preliminary results in regards to sage-grouse exposure to different levels of surface disturbance across different management scales both within and outside of sage-grouse Core Areas. Results will focus on habitat selection and productivity during the sage-grouse nesting period and relationships to exposure to different levels of surface disturbance and how these results relate to the 5% surface disturbance cap.',\n",

The scientific basis for this strategy was an analysis of sage-grouse breeding density as well as the results of research assessing the impacts of anthropogenic activity to sage-grouse demographics and habitat use. The Governor’s Sage-Grouse Implementation Team used the breeding density analysis as well as areas of existing or permitted anthropogenic activities to define the perimeters of the Core Areas. Core Area boundaries and executive order provisions were refined in 2010 under Freudenthal’s direction and again in 2015 as directed by current Governor Matt Mead. Core Areas cover approximately 25% of the state and provide protection for 81% of male sage-grouse counted on leks as well as the nesting, brood-rearing and winter habitat associated with those leks. The Executive Order stipulates that while existing land use rights should be recognized and respected, new development within Core Areas should be authorized only when it can be shown that the activity will not cause declines in sage-grouse populations. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2010 and 2015 listing decision documents supported Wyoming’s Core Area Strategy as an effective regulatory mechanism if implemented as planned.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Green River riparian corridor is a lush oasis in the vast sea of high desert sagebrush in southwest Wyoming. The Green River corridor provides many benefits to numerous aquatic and terrestrial wildlife species that depend on it for their life stage habitat needs. However, the riparian corridor is under attack from non-native species, namely Russian olive and Tamarisk (ROT). Since 2011, this attack has been thwarted by mechanical, chemical, and a combination of both methods. Collaborative efforts have focused multiple control treatments on the river corridor between Fontenelle Dam and the inflow area of Flaming Gorge Reservoir in order to promote landscape scale riparian system integrity and function. Cooperative partnerships between the Ashley National Forest, Boss Reclamation LCC, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, City of Green River, Field Services and Weed Control LLC, private landowners, Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge, Sweetwater County Recreation Board, Sweetwater County Weed and Pest District, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, Wyoming Governor’s Big Game License Coalition, Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative, Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments, and Wyoming Wildlife and Natural Resources Trust were instrumental in successfully controlling invasive ROT over the past 5 years. The initial project phase recruited partners to help with the control of the ROT. Then an assessment was completed by the Teton Science School to show where and how much ROT was on the landscape. The next phase was implementation; Sweetwater County Weed and Pest District and the City of Green River were crucial partners during this phase. The final phase is monitoring and maintenance; the City of Green River Schools is assisting with this phase. Removal of ROT within the Green River corridor is helping to sustain the system function of 37,700 acres of riparian habitat along a 72-mile reach of river.',\n",

There are thousands of irrigation headgates registered within the state of Wyoming, many of which restrict upstream movement, entrain thousands of fish into irrigation canals, or both. Habitat connectivity is crucial for fish movement and is often inhibited by diversion dams. One part of Wyoming’s fish passage program involves gathering evaluation data concerning irrigation headgates diverting water from the main water channel and diversion dams affecting upstream passage. The fish passage program has 1,174 point of diversions (POD) identified throughout the State. Within the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) boundary there are at least 514 POD, 276 completed, 205 not completed and 33 POD that were given no access from the landowner.

       "  'abstract': 'Studies typically show that the nutritional value of plants (i.e. percent crude protein, digestibility) increases following fire, yet burn severity is rarely considered. Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires in the western United States. Therefore, we need to improve our understanding of how wildfire burn severity affects ungulate forage quality and habitat use. The 2011 Red Rock Fire, which burned over 9,000 acres in the Gros Ventre watershed in Bridger-Teton National Forest, presents a unique opportunity to monitor short and long-term changes in the nutritional content of ungulate forage based on burn severity. Percent crude protein and digestibility of forage are directly related to ungulate reproduction, lactation, and juvenile survival. There is currently little information on burn severity affects plant nutritional content over time. We mapped and sampled 57 sites exposed to low, moderate, and high severity burns, as well as areas that were unburned. We sample 12 plant species annually at these sites to track nutritional changes over time. We are interested in tracking both short (1-5 years) and long-term (5-10+ years) plant responses post-fire. We have collected three years of data and preliminary results show a marked increase in crude protein related to burn intensity. Elk were fitted with GPS collars prior to the fire; therefore, we monitored pre and post-fire habitat use and observed a 6% increase in elk use within the burn perimeter, particularly in the moderate and high burn severity areas. This is one of the first studies of its kind to monitor changes in ungulate habitat use and forage quality as they relate to wildfire burn severity over the short and long term.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'State wildlife management agencies have a long history of determining and designating seasonal wildlife ranges. The accuracy of these ranges is important because they guide key management decisions such as seasonal area closures, development and disturbance restrictions, and research project study boundaries. Traditionally, seasonal wildlife ranges were delineated by local wildlife managers by hand-drawing polygons on maps based on their knowledge of animal use patterns in areas of their responsibility. In Wyoming, the Wildlife Observation System (WOS) has been used to supplement range delineations with observational data, however this dataset has drawbacks including road-bias, locations based on township and range sections, and inconsistent sampling effort. Since 2006, Wyoming Game and Fish’s Brucellosis-Feedground-Habitat (BFH) group has worked with multiple collaborators to deploy over 400 GPS collars and almost 300 vaginal implant transmitters (VITs) on elk in western Wyoming. The primary objective of these efforts is to better understand elk behavior and disease ecology to reduce the incidence of Brucella abortus in elk and reduce the risk of disease spillover to livestock. However, with such a large quantity of precise location data amassed, we were in a unique position to update elk seasonal range delineations for the seven herd units where collars and VITs were deployed. We followed the Wyoming Chapter of The Wildlife Society’s Standardized Definitions for Seasonal Wildlife Ranges, however we did deviate from these guidelines when defining parturition dates based on our data documenting live births and defining crucial winter range dates based on local expert knowledge. We applied a local convex hull model to the GPS data and a kernel density model to the WOS and VIT data, and allowed managers to manually edit the resulting ranges based on their local expertise. This effort is an excellent example of implementing research-based management and using research data for multiple purposes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Widespread acceptance of the importance of habitat in relation to wildlife population management is not a new concept. For decades, wildlife and habitat managers have attempted to manage one in concert with the other. However, increasing limitations on habitat and depressed wildlife populations relative to 30 years ago have forced managers to develop new tools to assess carrying capacity for the purpose of managing herds by objective. Opposed to the traditional model of monitoring several permanent locations over time, the authors developed standardized inventory methods to assess conditions of large-scale landscapes important to wildlife. These rapid assessments provide managers with understanding of how current habitat conditions function relative to big game population levels (i.e., population numbers are too high, balanced, or less than available habitat conditions). A secondary benefit of completing these assessments is the identification of areas suitable for management actions to benefit wildlife and overall watershed health. To date, assessments have been developed for shrub/rangeland, aspen, and riparian communities with plans to develop additional assessment for conifer and mountain herbaceous communities in the next year. Additionally, the authors will work with population managers to integrate the assessment data into the objective review process in identified mule deer herds across the state.',\n",

Concurrently, Wyoming has experienced drastic changes in environmental conditions, particularly in the form of severe droughts and harsh winters, which have the potential to result in decreased survival rates. Nation-wide, Wyoming has also seen some of the greatest increases in energy production, particularly in natural gas. Impacts of infrastructure associated with energy development can affect wildlife by altering resource selection patterns and vital rates, and many recent conservation science and policy efforts are based on reducing these impacts to wildlife populations. Between November 2013 and 2014, we captured and equipped 186 adult female pronghorn with GPS or VHF transmitters to evaluate the influence of anthropogenic and environmental factors on demographic patterns across four sites impacted by varying levels of energy extraction in south-central Wyoming. The objectives of our survival study include assessing the individual effects of environmental and anthropogenic change on risk as well as the possible interactive effects of these potential stressors. We estimated survival rates using the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator, modified for staggered entry. To model risk of survival, we used the Andersen-Gill formulation of the Cox Proportional Hazards model to assess survival as intervals of risk. Our work will increase knowledge of pronghorn demographic responses to increasing climatic variability and human presence on the landscape. As environmental conditions change and the demand for energy expands, our ability to separate and understand the influence of environmental change and resource extraction on pronghorn populations will be critical to guide efforts to manage and mitigate for their effects.',\n",

In recent years only a few mineral resources (other than coal, which is an organic fuel resource, and therefore not included in this study) are actively being sought or exploited in the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) study area. Over the past century there has been a significant shift away from small gold, copper, or iron mines. Today, hard rock mining is virtually non-existent in the study area, but other mineral extractions, such as for uranium and trona, are significant. A series of maps shows areas where mineral resources have been identified and, therefore, where there are likely to be past, present, or future impacts on the landscape due to mining activities. Base- and precious-metals, formerly the target of active mining, are no longer being produced. Most of these dormant deposits are in well-defined mineralized areas or mining districts. Iron remained an important commodity in Wyoming until recent decades. Uranium is being mined by in situ recovery in the northern part of Sweetwater County and additional uranium exploration and development projects have been proposed. Several non-metallic industrial minerals have been produced from the WLCI study area. Trona, mined for soda ash, is a significant commodity in Sweetwater County. Former phosphate mines (such as at Leefe and South Mountain) and prospects in the western part of the study area appear to have been either abandoned or reclaimed. Sand and gravel is being actively sought and produced from unconsolidated deposits; aggregate and crushed stone are produced from Paleozoic and younger sedimentary rock units. Other industrial commodities, such as dimension and building stone, gypsum, barite, clay, bentonite, helium, and sulfur are not included in this study.',\n",

Considering global and national demand for energy resources, it is likely that development will continue to expand throughout the American and Canadian West. Due to the risk of energy development there is a need to better define distribution and habitat use of small mammal species that are rare and difficult to detect. The first goal is to create repeatable small mammal survey protocols designed to optimize the detection of rare and difficult to detect species, such as pocket mice, when they co-occur with abundant competitors, such as deer mice. The second goal is to develop an occupancy-based monitoring plan for my target small mammal species, which will result in baseline occupancy estimates across Wyoming’s basins and allow accurate evaluation of habitat associations that accounts for low detectability. The resulting data will be used to reassess the distribution and conservation status the target species. The third goal is to conduct habitat analysis based on survey data to clarify habitat associations of the target species in Wyoming. The expected result is improved habitat data for the sensitive and rare small mammal species surveyed in this project which may lead to more informed, effective management decisions. Having a better understanding of the habitat requirement, niche partitioning, and occupancy of these small mammal communities will lead to more effective conservation of these rare species.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Population estimates of big games species are essential for biologists to manage productive herds while still maintaining annual hunter harvests. Many state agencies conduct herd composition surveys via helicopter or fixed wing aircraft, which are both costly and potentially dangerous to the biologists involved. Further complicating the estimation of herd productivity is the aggregation of migratory and resident herds on seasonal habitats. Several migratory elk (Cervus elaphus) herds in northwestern Wyoming share winter habitat with resident herds, making it difficult to attain herd specific composition data. To gather composition data pertaining to each of these herds separately, and to better understand patterns in the timing of migration, we deployed remote trail cameras at geographic ‘bottlenecks’ to monitor migrating elk herds. Bottlenecks were identified with fine temporal scale GPS collar data in isolated regions were several migration routes overlapped. A total of 29 and 32 trail cameras were deployed at potential monitoring sites in the fall of 2014 and 2015 respectively. Cameras were left in place throughout the winter and spring months to capture both seasonal migrations. Although our results are preliminary, the camera data allow for several useful comparisons, namely i) variation in peak migration timing between herds, ii) the timing of fall migration for bulls versus cows, and iii) indices of calf survival. The duration of the peak fall migration varied with geographic region, ranging from two to five weeks. The duration of peak spring migration ranged from two to four weeks across regions. The majority of adult bulls migrated with the earliest groups in spring and up to two weeks later than cow and calf groups in the fall. We were not able to assess overwinter calf survival due to difficulty classifying yearling elk; however, summer survival rates were approximated, showing a general decrease in calf survival from spring to fall. Successful camera locations have potential to be used as a long term monitoring network where migratory herds can be predictably photographed year after year. Longterm data on compositional trends and timing of spring and fall migrations, will aid in developing herd management objectives and reduce annual survey costs.',\n",

The wells were completed in the uppermost aquifers of the Green River Basin lower Tertiary aquifer system, which is a complex regional aquifer system that provides water to most wells in the area. Drilled depth of the wells was observed as a useful indicator of depth to groundwater such that deeper wells typically had a greater depth to groundwater. Comparison of a subset of wells included in this study that had historical groundwater levels that were measured during the 1960s and 1970s and again between 2012 and 2014 indicated that, overall, most of the wells showed a net decline in groundwater levels. The groundwater-level measurements were used to construct a generalized potentiometric- surface map of the Green River Basin lower Tertiary aquifer system. Groundwater-level altitudes measured in nonflowing and flowing wells used to construct the potentiometric-surface map ranged from 6,451 to 7,307 feet (excluding four unmeasured flowing wells used for contour construction purposes). The potentiometric-surface map indicates that groundwater in the study area generally moves from north to south, but this pattern of flow is altered locally by groundwater divides, groundwater discharge to the Green River, and possibly to a tributary river (Big Sandy River) and two reservoirs (Fontenelle and Big Sandy Reservoirs).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'For large ungulates, factors such as nutrition, energetics, and hiding and thermal cover all influence resource selection. For nearly two decades, the forests of the Rocky Mountains (USA) have been experiencing a bark beetle epidemic of severity and duration that has not been seen in over a 100 years. Between northern Colorado and southern Wyoming, the mountain pine beetle (Dendoctronus ponderosae) alone has caused mortalities in over 1.5 million hectares of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest. As the epidemic changes the structure and characteristics of the forest, the ungulates that inhabit these areas may alter their resource selection patterns to adapt to changing habitats. Moreover, ungulate distributional shifts may also lead to changes in the hunting patterns of humans, which are the primary predator of adult ungulates in affected forests. We are evaluating how the resource selection of elk (Cervus elaphus) is being influenced by the bark beetle epidemic in the Sierra Madre Mountains of southeast Wyoming. By employing global positioning system (GPS) technology to document the movements of elk, we are quantifying how elk move about a forest with increased downed trees and understory vegetation and a potential reduction of thermal and hiding cover. Specifically, we will use a satellite–derived land classification to develop resource selection functions for elk to examine resource selection during various stages of beetle killed forests. In addition, we are coupling our analysis of elk resource selection with an analysis of how beetle kill is influencing hunter movements and interactions with elk. This work is done through voluntary monitoring of hunter movement paths during the fall hunting season. Our work will provide novel insights into how the bark beetle epidemic will influence elk resource selection and hunter effort, and this information will inform wildlife and land management decisions regarding ungulates and hunting in beetle killed forests.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Food caching, the storage of food for future use, is a strategy many animals use to combat times of reduced food availability. In many cases, caches provide critical reserves that allow animals to persist in environments where food is lacking or absent during much of the year. Careful arrangement of food within stores may further facilitate physical integrity of the cache, improve food preservation, or ensure that cached resources meet future nutritional demands. Although many studies have addressed food caching as a strategy, no published studies have examined whether a systematic arrangement exists within individual food stores. The American pika (Ochotona princeps), a food caching, montane mammal, is an ideal study organism for evaluating the extent to which animals organize and structure caches. We evaluated variation in cache structure by addressing four hypotheses regarding the number of caches per individual, relative age (adult or juvenile), cache volume, and available vegetation. We defined structure as the presence of horizontal layers composed of homogeneous plant functional groups. We identified homogeneous layers using a modified line-intercept method. Thirty-six percent of the 55 caches sampled showed evidence of within-cache layering at the level of plant functional groups. Subsequent analyses will consider the degree to which the distance to nearest vegetation, diversity in available vegetation, number of haypiles per individual, individual stage (juvenile/adult), and haypile volume influence haypile structure. Understanding the extent to which animals organize over-winter reserves will provide insight to the range of food-caching strategies employed in variable environments. This understanding may provide a platform from which future researchers can explore the relationship between cache structure and individual fitness.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The leading cause of reproductive failure for most passerine birds is nest predation. Because nest predation can strongly limit fitness, selection should favor birds that are able to assess predator communities within their home range and adjust nest sites accordingly. We are investigating the mechanisms that drive nest site selection and nest success in the Island Scrub-Jay by 1) comparing nest sites to paired non-use, but available nest sites, 2) identifying important nest predator species, and 3) quantifying reproductive investment, nest survival, and the abundance of main nest predators (Common Ravens (Corvus corax) and Island Foxes (Urocyon littoralis) across 2 habitat types, Bishop Pine woodland and Oak Chaparral. Between February 10 and June 15 2015 we located and monitored 105 nests through fledge or fail and conducted microhabitat analyses on each. We deployed 24 hour infrared bullet cameras at a subset of nests to capture predation events. We used distance sampling of fox scat along transects and raven point counts from a single high visibility location on each plot to estimate a relative index of predator activity. Preliminary results suggest a relatively low number of nest attempts and smaller clutch sizes in the pines suggesting that pine habitat is suboptimal for breeding. However, both the Common Raven and the Island Fox were detected in lower numbers and nest success rates were higher in the pines. This suggests that despite lower food availability, there was lower nest predation pressure in the pines, offering survival benefits to pine residents. Our work in this system has broader implications in terms of understanding habitat choices in different ecological contexts and fitness trade-offs of selecting habitats with contrasting resource availability such as food and refugia from predation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Many amphibians in the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest (MBR) are state Species of Concern/Greatest Conservation Need, partly due to lack of information, in part because of low detection rates. Using eDNA to establish amphibian presence could: increase accuracy and decrease costs of surveys, increase the number of sites sampled per unit effort, refine distribution and extinction records, and provide early detection of invasive species without any risk to the local ecosystem. Quality presence/absence data responsibly inform effective management decisions, a critical factor in this era of dwindling resources. To determine whether and in what circumstances molecular surveys can augment efficiency of amphibian monitoring and detection, we will: 1) Develop and troubleshoot molecular markers (quantitative PCR) for all five local amphibian species (4/5 currently developed-Lithobates sylvaticus excepting), 2) compare estimated rates of detection and occupancy by species for each method 3) use estimated detection rates to conduct cost/benefit analyses, and 4) determine eDNA’s ability to reliably identify amphibian breeding sites. In summer 2015, we implemented eDNA based survey efforts into an existing long term amphibian monitoring effort in the MBR using 20 wetland catchments stratified by elevation and known species presence. This will allow effective occupancy modeling to establish molecular efficiency of detection probability, species rarity, etc. Collected naïve detection rates are as follows: Psuedacris maculata (.383), Ambystoma mavortium (.092), Anaxyrus boreas (.067), Lithobates pipiens (.042), and Lithobates sylvaticus (.133). Based on previous, similar work indicating up to two-fold detection improvements, we expect to find marked increases for more cryptic species like A. mavortium, A. boreas, and L. sylvaticus.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Management for one or a few focal species is a common practice, but this technique is not adequate in complex landscapes with diverse animal communities. The Thunder Basin National Grasslands (TBNG) of northeastern Wyoming are composed of a heterogeneous mosaic of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), short-grass, and mixed-grass plant communities. Portions of TBNG have been designated as core area for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus); these areas are important for the conservation of this Wyoming Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), as well as other sagebrush obligate birds. The grasslands also support one of the largest complexes of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) in North America, and have been prioritized as a reintroduction zone for the endangered black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes). These shortgrass prairie dog colonies also provide critical breeding habitat for the mountain plover (Charadrius montanus), a Wyoming SGCN, and USFS Species of Conservation Concern. Conservation of these diverse species in the same landscape requires spatial optimization of management approaches and a better understanding of spatial tradeoffs. With this in mind, we initiated a pilot study in summer 2015 to examine how shortgrass, mixed-grass, and sagebrush obligate bird species are influenced by the composition and spatial configuration of habitat patches in the Thunder Basin landscape. We surveyed birds on transects placed across sage grouse leks (“sagebrush,” n=10), prairie dog colonies (“shortgrass,” n = 10), and also across edges between colonies and adjacent habitat (“edge,” n = 41). We will use data collected over the next three years (2016–2018) to generate models of single species density as a function of local and landscape habitat variables. Based on these models, we will identify optimal habitat configurations of colonies and sagebrush to maximize habitat availability for both sagebrush and grassland birds in the Thunder Basin landscape.',\n",

Human-induced habitat disturbance and alteration have been cited as a dominate causes, which can interact with other stressors such as climate change and disease. In the majority of cases, however, mechanisms underlying declines are considered enigmatic; therefore, developing a better understanding of the individual and interactive factors threating amphibians will be critical to prevent further population declines and species extinctions. To investigate the possible effects of multiple stressors on amphibians, we will assess how livestock grazing individually and in conjunction with disease may affect boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas) movement, habitat selection, and survival in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in western Wyoming. In 2015, we used radio-telemetry to study the summer movements and habitat use of 61 adult boreal toads (40 male and 21 female) across sites varying in grazing intensity. Additionally, we swabbed individuals for disease and inserted passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags into 302 adult toads. We will analyze habitat selection at the micro- and macro-scales by comparing sites used by radio-tracked toads with paired and randomly selected sites. In 2016 and 2017, we will conduct recapture surveys to evaluate toad survival rates. We will also test swab samples for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) to evaluate disease status of boreal toads across several drainages. Findings from this study will provide valuable information to several agencies working to improve management of toad populations in Wyoming. More broadly, by assessing how multiple stressors may interact to influence amphibian behavior, ecology, and habitat quality, our study design may provide a framework for future research evaluating causative factors in amphibian declines.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Migratory animals face an increasingly uncertain future as migration routes are severed or threatened by anthropogenic influences, persistent and wide-ranging drought alters vegetation communities, and population trends edge downward. Research and conservation efforts in recent years have focused on understanding the importance of specific habitats, such as stopovers or bottlenecks. To conserve migration routes in their entirety, as opposed to specific sections of some migration corridors, an understanding of where migrations occur at the landscape-scale is necessary. To bridge the gap between current local knowledge of migration habitat and corridors gleaned from intensive GPS collaring efforts, we developed a machine learning model to predict migratory areas for mule deer throughout the state of Wyoming. We used landscape variables, including topographic metrics and plant phenology metrics, which have been shown to be important in previous migration research. The model was highly accurate in predicting migratory habitat, matching known migratory data more than 85% of the time. Although the resulting prediction surface does not allow a complete understanding of factors influencing habitat selection in migration corridors, a statewide prediction of areas that are more or less likely to be migratory habitat for mule deer will aid in targeting conservation measures and conserving migration routes and migratory populations. Our methodology to analyze and predict migration habitat across vast landscapes allows migratory habitats to be mapped range-wide where sufficient location data exists; although our model focuses on mule deer, the same concept and model could be easily applied to other taxa. Conservation efforts for declining mule deer populations can benefit from these methods by identifying key areas to focus attention and areas where future research should be conducted.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Green Wave Hypothesis (GWH) states that migrating animals should track or “surf” the leading edge of spring green-up where forage quality is highest. To index such peaks in forage quality, recent work has proposed the instantaneous rate of green-up (IRG) or change in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) curve over time. Despite this advancement, no study has tested the assumption that herbivores select habitat patches at peak IRG in accordance with the GWH. We evaluated this assumption using Step Selection Functions parameterized with movement data during the green-up period from two populations each of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), elk (Cervus elaphus), moose (Alces alces), and bison (Bison bison), totaling 463 individuals monitored 1–3 years between 2004 and 2014. After accounting for habitat attributes that typically influence selection by each species, seven of the 10 populations selected habitat patches exhibiting high IRG. Elk and deer tended to select habitat patches at the trailing edge of the IRG wave, whereas all others except for a single bison population selected habitat patches at the crest of the IRG wave. In support of the GWH, the majority of the populations surfed a green wave of high quality forage in spring as indexed by IRG. Our finding that not all populations surf at the crest of the IRG wave indicates that there may be other constraints to optimal surfing not captured by remotely sensed data. Nonetheless, it appears that the NDVI-derived IRG provides a new framework for understanding and predicting animal migration and movement across species and study areas. Most importantly, the IRG metric now allows wildlife biologists, researchers, and managers to assess how habitat quality changes over time throughout the growing season, a dynamic that is becoming increasingly important in the era of global climate change.',\n",

Metal contamination from mining effluent can modify the biofilm community structure, diversity, and activity. The biofilm response to metal toxicity can be quantitatively measured at a low cost with recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technology. We have used this technology to identify the biofilm community at 11 historically monitored sites in a designated superfund site in the Clark Fork Basin, Montana. The bacterial genus Lysobacter was identified as a potential biomarker of metal contamination by integrating the geochemistry at the sites with the biofilm community results. Monitoring metal toxicity in rivers has been difficult because complex biogeochemical processes and variable flow conditions can mask direct relations between metal concentrations and toxicity. Biofilms could be an effective biomarker of metal toxicity because that are resistant to changes in flow, rapidly respond to environmental perturbation, and play an important role determining metal mobility. The identification of a predictable biofilm response to heavy metal contamination could provide an effective tool to monitor the estimated 20,000 to 50,000 mine sites that contribute to heavy metal contamination and threaten many rivers in the western United States.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Partial migration occurs across a variety of taxa and has important ecological and evolutionary consequences. Among ungulates, studies of partially migratory populations have allowed researchers to compare and contrast performance metrics of migrants versus residents and examine how environmental factors influence the relative abundance of each. Such studies tend to characterize animals discretely as either migratory or resident, but we suggest that variable migration distances within migratory subpopulations may represent an important and overlooked form of population structure, with potential consequences for animal fitness. We examined whether the variation of individual migration distances (20 to 264 km) within a single mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) population was associated with several critical behavioral attributes of migration including the timing of migration, time allocation to seasonal ranges, and exposure to anthropogenic mortality risks. We found that migration distance influenced both the timing of migration and the amount of time animals allocated to seasonal ranges. Animals migrating long distances (150 to 250 km) initiated spring migration more than 30 days before those migrating moderate (50 to 150 km) or short distances (< 50 km). Long-distance migrants spent approximately 100 more days migrating compared to moderate and short-distance migrants. Relatedly, the winter residency of long-distance migrants was 70 days less than animals migrating shorter distances. We also found that anthropogenic mortality factors, including highways, fences, and harvest vulnerability varied strongly with migration distance. Clear differences in winter residency, migration duration, and levels of anthropogenic mortality risk among the short, moderate, and longdistance migrants suggests distinct fitness tradeoffs among the migratory segment of the population. By reducing the amount of time that animals spend on winter range, long-distance migration may alleviate intraspecific competition for limited forage supplies and effectively increase carrying capacity of the larger population.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Climate change models for the northern Rocky Mountains predict warming and changes in water availability that may alter vegetation. Changes to vegetation may include timing of plant life history events, or phenology, such as green-up, flowering, and senescence. These changes could make forage available earlier in the growing season, but shifts in phenology may also result in earlier senescence (die-off or dormancy) and changes in overall production. Measures of plant photosynthesis, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are regularly used to quantify plant growth and health over large areas using remotely sensed reflectance data. Such remote-sensing vegetation indices (VI) are often used as a spatial and temporal indicator of productivity and habitat quality, but an additional indicator of habitat quality is animal use. In this work we use stopover areas – where mule deer linger during their spring migrations – as hypothesized vegetation productivity “hotspots” on the landscape – areas that are more productive relative to their surroundings as indicated by VIs. We compared the VI characteristics of a subset of stopover polygons to an adjacent area and to a non-adjacent area with the same vegetation cover classification on the migration route. Comparisons were made twice: the relatively wet year of 2014 and the relatively dry year of 2013. Fitness (body fat and reproductive status) of the individual deer identifying the sampled stopovers was noted for each year. Coupling animal use and fitness with greenness information provides additional insight into habitat quality of stopover areas. Detailed understanding of spatial and temporal use of the landscape may allow more long-term, strategic surface management.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Migration is a strategy that allows herbivores to exploit high-quality resources available on one seasonal range, while avoiding resource deficiencies on the other. Increasingly, research suggests that the migratory route is a critical habitat, and not merely a means to connect seasonal ranges. The Green Wave Hypothesis predicts that migratory ungulates access young, highly nutritious forage while moving along the leading edge of the spring green-up, i.e., the green wave. This hypothesis has seen limited evaluation, and yet is central to understanding the consequences of climateinduced phenological changes for migratory ungulates. We tested the Green Wave Hypothesis by evaluating the match between plant phenology and spring movements (i.e., surfing) of migratory mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in western Wyoming. We also investigated the influence of drought on patterns of green-up and the subsequent influence on the ability of deer to surf the green wave. We quantified plant phenology along migratory routes by calculating the instantaneous rate of green-up (IRG) from annual curves of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, MODIS 250m). In support of the Green Wave Hypothesis, date of optimal IRG and the date of deer occupation during migration was positively related (n=1216 locations, r 2=0.53, P<0.001). Individuals (n=38) varied in their ability to surf the green wave: 42% following it closely, 55% tracked behind the green wave, and 2% deer tracked ahead of the green wave. Based on annual time series of NDVI, duration of green-up decreased with increased drought severity (Palmer modified drought index, r2=0.44, P=0.004), increased temperature (r2=0.24, P=0.06), and earlier loss of snow cover (r2=0.34, P=0.02). Our work indicates that mule deer surf the green wave while migrating, but continued drought is likely to reduce the foraging benefit of migration by shortening the duration of spring green-up along migration routes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'For North American ungulates, availability of resources on winter ranges often is limited in quality and abundance; consequently, individuals often rely on somatic-energy reserves (i.e., fat and protein) during winter to promote reproduction and survival. Encroachment of human disturbance onto winter ranges may further exacerbate the nutritional bottleneck by prompting avoidance of otherwise available habitat and altering foraging behavior. Although behavioral responses to human disturbance affect population dynamics, the proximate mechanisms that underpin these effects are difficult to identify. We hypothesized that behavioral responses to human disturbance that directly affect nutritional condition is the pathway by which human disturbance may influence ungulate populations. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated winter habitat condition, browse use by herbivores, and seasonal change in nutritional condition (i.e., % body fat) of 148 female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) equipped with GPS collars across three discrete winter ranges that varied in intensity of human disturbance from energy development. We used these data to explore the relationships among behavior, nutritional condition, winter habitat conditions, and exposure to human disturbance. Use of available browse was affected most by proximity to energy development and annual production of browse, but browse use decreased closer to development. Furthermore, deer that resided near development had increased movement rates, and in turn, movement rates negatively affected nutritional condition. Our results indicate mule deer on winter ranges exposed to human disturbance alter behavior in a way that can negatively affect nutritional condition, thereby potentially revealing the link between human disturbance and the ensuing effects on population dynamics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Wyoming harbors vast, open landscapes still capable of supporting long-distance ungulate migrations. Herds of big game move across rugged landscapes up to 150 miles seasonally to find adequate forage. While this foraging strategy allows animals to exploit gradients in snowfall and forage productivity, it also requires that they cross multiple-use lands, some of which are changing rapidly. Consequently, ungulate migration as an ecological process is difficult to manage and conserve. Recent research has enhanced our understanding of both the benefits of migration and the consequences of land-use change. This talk will describe some of the most pressing challenges to the conservation of ungulate migration routes in Wyoming and the West. Most importantly, I will outline recent research indicating how the behavioral responses of migrating ungulates to disturbance, from energy and housing development, holds the potential to diminish the benefits of migration and lead to its loss across impacted landscapes. Incorporating new scientific information into the management and conservation of ungulate migrations is a daunting task. In 2012, we created the Wyoming Migration Initiative (WMI), whose mission is To advance the understanding, appreciation, and conservation of Wyoming's migratory ungulates by conducting innovative research and sharing scientific information through public outreach. I will conclude with a description of some of WMI's recent work and the new conservation tools that our bringing people, agencies, and NGOs together to make these journeys easier for migrating big game.\",\n",

Sage-grouse in northeast Wyoming subsist on a lower density of sagebrush and live with a higher density of energy development compared to birds elsewhere in Wyoming. When compared to other sage-grouse populations affected by energy development, there is a relatively dense population of sage-grouse in the central portion of the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming. To determine why this population of sage-grouse appears to persist despite intensive development we used spatial statistics within a geographic information system to examine the size and orientation of active sage-grouse leks and compared those to the location and timing of well development and associated surface disturbance. Using these same methods, we examined the pattern and location of undeveloped or open space around the active sage-grouse leks within the study area. The results and management implications of these ongoing analyses will be discussed. Results could impact well distribution around active leks or management practices in other regions and help balance the multiple uses that sagebrush habitats in Wyoming must sustain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata wyomingensis) is the most widely distributed subspecies of big sagebrush and has been treated through chemical application, mechanical treatments, and prescribed burning to improve habitat conditions for species such as greater sagegrouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Although the response of structural attributes of sagebrush communities to treatments is well understood, there is a need to identify how sagebrush treatments influence the quality of winter food available for wildlife. The purpose of our research was to identify how mowing and herbicide treatments intended to reduce sagebrush canopy cover influenced dietary quality of Wyoming big sagebrush in treated Wyoming big sagebrush communities in central Wyoming. Two study areas were mowed in January and February 2014 and herbicide was applied in two study areas in May 2014. We constructed six exclosures in each study area (24 total), which encompassed 30 m X 30 m areas of treated and untreated sagebrush within each exclosure. Samples of current annual growth were collected from 18 sagebrush plants from treatment sites and 12 plants from control sites within each exclosure during November 2013 and 2014. Samples were analyzed for crude protein and secondary metabolites known to influence dietary selection of sagebrush by sage-grouse and other species. Preliminary results suggest that mowing treatments may slightly increase nutrient concentrations directly after treatments without immediate changes in secondary metabolites. Assessing dietary quality during additional years following treatments and potential trade-offs with loss of biomass associated with treatments will allow us to determine the influence of sagebrush treatments on dietary quality for sage-grouse and other co-occurring wildlife.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The USGS has been conducting sagebrush and vegetation change monitoring in WLCI with field measurements every year since 2008, and with satellite remote sensing since1985. Remote sensing offers the opportunity to scale up field measurements and subsequently provide wall to wall WLCI vegetation monitoring. We quantified sagebrush habitat as components of bare ground, shrub, sagebrush, herbaceousness and litter. Once components were quantified using current satellite measurements, previous year satellite images from the Landsat archive were then quantified to understand historical trends. Analysis of imagery back to1985 shows components of bare ground and herbaceous increasing over time and sagebrush decreasing over time across the WLCI. We then applied a linear model to relate the historical trend of the component value for each pixel to the historical precipitation trend – and projected this into the future for the year 2050. This process provides a way to quantify the potential impact of future climate change on the quantity of sagebrush components. Results indicate that with projected 2050 precipitation amounts, sagebrush will continue to decline and bare ground to increase across WLCI. When 2050 quantities of change are translated to sage grouse habitat in a subset of WLCI, there is a projected loss of 4% of summer sage grouse habitat and 11% of nesting sage grouse habitat by climate change alone. Future work will provide more comprehensive analysis of potential climate change and sage grouse habitat effects. In addition, a major new USGS and BLM effort is underway to update sagebrush habitat components for all of Wyoming using 2015 satellite measurements. These products will also provide per-pixel estimates of bare ground, sagebrush, shrub, herbaceousness, annual herbaceousness, shrub height, and litter and are designed to provide a new base for future monitoring.',\n",

However, sage-grouse population response to grazing management has yet to be evaluated across large spatial extents. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) currently oversees grazing on nearly 250,000 km2 of sagebrush land, and their records provide a unique opportunity to assess the response of sage-grouse populations to rangeland management. We used grazing data collected by BLM from grazing allotments in the state of Wyoming to test response of sage-grouse to the timing and intensity of grazing, and interactions with vegetation productivity. We used annual counts of displaying males from 673 lek sites (2004- 2014) and modeled population trends using state-space models in a Bayesian framework. We estimated a positive response to sagebrush cover, whereas effects from grazing timing and intensity varied with vegetation productivity. Among drier sites with low vegetation productivity, early grazing was compatible with sage-grouse populations but at lower intensities; higher intensity grazing was permissible later in the growing season. Conversely, we found that late-season grazing among mesic sites, particularly at high intensities, had a negative effect on sage-grouse populations. While the exact mechanisms behind these trends remain to be tested at finer scales, our findings may inform future grazing management policies by BLM and other agencies, as well as on private lands.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sagebrush ecosystems in the United States have experienced significant changes over the last century resulting in an approximately 50% loss, due to grazing, fire, and agricultural, urban, and energy development. The greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is dependent on sagebrush throughout its life history and, therefore, has also experienced large declines in distribution and abundance. One potential threat to populations is the increase in development associated with oil and natural gas extraction. Wyoming contains approximately 40% of sagegrouse range-wide and has experienced a rapid increase in energy development, with that trend expected to continue with increased energy demands. Understanding how these changes may impact populations could help guide future management of populations. We used a Bayesian statespace model to estimate the impacts of energy development, habitat, and precipitation on changes in lek attendance of male sage-grouse in Wyoming from 1984-2008. We explored these covariates at various scales and time lags to account for demographic and behavioral responses to development. We found annual declines in lek attendance of 1.3% across the state, with regional trends ranging from -9.5% to 2.6%. Well density within 6.4 km of a lek at a 4-year lag provided the best predictive ability of all energy development metrics and had negative impacts on lek attendance. Sagebrush cover had no effect and average spring precipitation within 3.2 km two years prior had a negative effect on changes in lek attendance. Our findings suggest that sage-grouse may experience further declines in Wyoming as energy development is expected to increase in the future. A combination of restrictions on development, mitigating efforts, and restoration of sagebrush may offset the impacts of oil and gas development on sage-grouse populations.',\n",

We investigated trends for Wyoming sagegrouse populations. We developed lek clusters using a minimum spanning tree algorithm informed from sage-grouse habitat surrogates. We then used population viability analysis (PVA) and tested density-independent (DI) and density-dependent (DD) models within each cluster to account for movements between leks. Lek count data (Wyoming Game and Fish Department) were used in models after averaging number of peak male counts per lek annually. Counts were limited to those collected from 1993 to 2015, during March 1–May 31, and 30 minutes pre-sunrise to 90 minutes post-sunrise. The DI model resulted in lambda values (λ, finite rate of population growth) of 1.01 statewide and <1.0 for two out of ten clusters for the period 1993-2015 (range: 0.96 – 1.26), and 0.98 statewide and <1.0 for seven out of ten clusters for the period 1993-2014 (range: 0.94 – 1.29). The DD models resulted in λ<1.0 for the statewide population and all ten clusters for both time periods. Results indicate population increase in 2015 had large impact on raising λ for DI model but not for DD models. Further monitoring is required to determine if populations will continue to increase. Currently we are further generating another spatially hierarchical cluster level to continue PVA at a finer scale. Clusters will allow managers to target populations that are in greatest need of conservation attention, based on our PVA and current and future threats on the landscape.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'During the past 100 years, regulated harvest of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter ”sage-grouse”) has been overseen by 11 state and two provincial wildlife management agencies throughout western North America. These agencies progressively changed harvest season regulations to reduce the potential for negative effects of hunter harvest on sage-grouse populations. Changes to season regulations (area open, bag/possession limits, season length, and season start date) are the primary mechanism that wildlife agencies use to manipulate the number of upland game harvested annually. However, there has not been a robust assessment of the relationship of each season regulation in manipulating numbers harvested. The true number of sage-grouse harvested annually is unknown, but management agencies conduct harvest surveys to estimate the number harvested each year. Concurrently, there has been recognition that survey bias existed historically, and factors outside of the control of management agencies lead to differential exposure to harvest (i.e., cities, human population density, land ownership, roads, and weather during the hunting season). We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the influence of harvest season regulations, harvest survey variables (hunt type [sage-grouse versus upland game] and survey type [mail, permit, phone, or web]), and exposure to harvest variables on the annual estimated number of sage-grouse harvested. Our analysis spanned 1995 to 2013 and included harvest data from California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming. Estimated harvest numbers were positively associated with possession limit, earlier and wetter opening weekends, and closer proximity to a city. Mail-in harvest surveys and upland game hunts produced higher harvest estimates compared to permit, phone, and web surveys and sage-grouse specific hunts, respectively. Harvest regulations implemented by management agencies were effective at reducing the number of harvested sage-grouse; however, care needs to be taken when comparing harvest estimates with different harvest survey methodologies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Wyoming is among nearly a dozen western states/provinces that have delineated core population areas for the Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). These semi-protected areas contributed to the recent decision that sage-grouse do not warrant protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and will likely be maintained in the continued effort to stave of sage-grouse population declines. Many suppose that such protections for sage-grouse also support hundreds of other species associated with sagebrush-steppe habitats; however, few studies have documented the extent to which this is a valid assumption. We addressed three questions: 1) How much overlap does the Core Area have with the suitable habitat of 52 of Wyoming’s Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN)? 2) If the Core Area was bigger or smaller, how would that affect those SGCN species? 3) Does the Core Area protect SGCN species’ habitat just because the Core Area is really big? 4) Which kinds of SGCN are best protected by the Core Area? We found that the proportion of each species’ habitat that overlaps the Core Area ranges from 0-63% (median = 17%). Second, the bigger the Core Area, the better it is for more SGCN species. Hypothetical Core Areas sited with no respect to sage-grouse populations, moreover, but equal in size to the established Core Area, protected as much, or more SGCN habitat than the established Core Area did, for 40 of the 52 SGCN species. Finally, SGCN species most similar to sage-grouse are the best served by the sage-grouse Core Area. Our findings confirm that many at-risk species receive some protection under the umbrella of sage-grouse conservation, but with important caveats about Core Area size and species attributes, and species that do not appear to fit under the sage-grouse umbrella.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Understanding factors influencing changes in population trajectory is important for effective wildlife management, particularly for populations of conservation concern. Annual population growth of the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, USA has slowed from 4.2–7.6% during 1983–2001 to 0.3–2.2% during 2002–2011. Substantial changes in availability of a key food source and bear population density have occurred. Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), the seeds of which are a valuable but variable fall food for grizzly bears, has experienced substantial mortality primarily due to a mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak that started in the early 2000s. Positive growth rates of grizzly bears have resulted in populations reaching high densities in some areas and have contributed to continued range expansion. We tested research hypotheses to examine if changes in vital rates detected during the past decade were more associated with whitebark pine decline or, alternatively, increasing grizzly bear density. We focused our assessment on known-fate data to estimate survival of cubsof-the-year (cubs), yearlings, and independent bears (≥2 yrs), and reproductive transition of females from having no offspring to having cubs. We used spatially and temporally explicit indices for grizzly bear density and whitebark pine mortality as individual covariates. Models indicated moderate support for an increase in survival of independent male bears over 1983–2012, whereas independent female survival did not change. Cub survival, yearling survival, and reproductive transition from no offspring to cubs all changed during the 30-year study period, with lower rates evident during the last 10–15 years. Cub survival and reproductive transition were negatively associated with an index of grizzly bear density, indicating greater declines where bear densities were higher. Our analyses did not support a similar relationship for the index of whitebark pine mortality. The results of our study support the interpretation that slowing of population growth during the last decade was associated more with increasing grizzly bear density than the decline in whitebark pine. Grizzly bear density and its potential effect on vital rates and population trajectory warrant consideration for management of the grizzly bear population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Wyoming’s wildlife is composed of vastly more invertebrates than vertebrates; in fact, about 99% of animal taxa in the state and on the planet lack spines. Invertebrate animals increase plant fecundity via pollination, regulate plant biomass through herbivory, make up a large fraction of the diet of many vertebrate animals, contribute to decomposition and nutrient cycling, and affect many other fundamental ecological processes. Despite their high diversity, ubiquity and various contributions to ecosystems, far less is known about invertebrate compared to vertebrate animals. The frequent lack of basic information makes identifying and managing rare and sensitive invertebrates extremely difficult. The Wyoming Natural Diversity Database at the University of Wyoming summarized existing knowledge of rare invertebrates in the state. Currently, 131 invertebrate taxa of concern (32 insects, 28 crustaceans, 71 mollusks) are known to occupy the state. No invertebrates are currently protected under the Endangered Species Act in Wyoming; however, four insects and 11 mollusks are ESA-listed in neighboring states. ESA petitions for invertebrates appear to be increasing in frequency across the region and three Wyoming invertebrates (Narrow-footed Predaceous Diving Beetle, Monarch Butterfly, Regal Fritillary) are currently petitioned for ESA listing. This presentation will introduce Wyoming invertebrates of concern and discuss how ESA-listed invertebrates may impact the state.',\n",

Cottontails (Sylvilagus spp.) were the most frequently occurring prey in the Golden Eagle nesting diet (determined by prey remains in nest) in each year of our study, ranging from 48% of individuals identified to 86% of individuals identified. Hunter surveys indicate that cottontails in Wyoming exhibit dramatic, cyclic population fluctuations, peaking approximately every six to eight years. Data we acquired through roadside spotlight surveys in the Bighorn Basin are generally consistent with the statewide hunter survey data. The number of cottontails we detected during our peak year (2015) was nearly triple the number of cottontails we detected in our trough year (2013). Golden Eagle nesting diet breadth increased when cottontail abundance declined, but no other single prey species gained singular importance. Golden Eagle nesting success and productivity plummeted when cottontail abundance dropped, despite nesting eagles exploiting a wider range of prey during years when cottontail abundance was low. The multiple-use, sagebrush-steppe environment in the Bighorn Basin is undergoing profound changes related to exurban sprawl, energy development, and recreational activities. Thus, a key to Golden Eagle conservation, at least in the changing world of the Bighorn Basin, lies in maintaining or enhancing environmental conditions that support robust, albeit cyclic, cottontail populations.',\n",

Wyoming Game and Fish Department funded a study in the early 1980’s to survey breeding distributions in western Wyoming and identified an area near Daniel as having the highest breeding density in the state. Roadside surveys since the 1990s suggest that numbers may have declined in WY. Similarly, declines have been recently documented in some areas of Idaho. To investigate the current status of this species, preliminary work began in 2014, when Intermountain Bird Observatory (IBO) tagged the first Wyoming curlew with a satellite transmitter on the National Elk Refuge in Jackson. This female adult ended up wintering at a site on the coast of western Mexico where no previously marked curlews from the Intermountain West had been documented. In 2015, IBO studied reproductive success at six breeding sites in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana including the two historic study areas in Pinedale and Daniel and a new site in Cody. Seven additional curlews were tagged in Wyoming and migration data from fall 2015 suggest that there may be a divide in Wyoming’s birds. Curlews from the Jackson and Pinedale areas migrated to sites in the Imperial Valley and western Mexico compared to the Cody birds which moved to central Mexico. This talk will present preliminary demographic data from Wyoming and discuss conservation risks and opportunities for this species. Support for this study was generously provided by Wyoming state legislative funds, the Bureau of Land Management, Wyoming Governor's Big Game License Coalition, and the Meg and Bert Raynes Wildlife Fund.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Food habits of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are of increasing interest to wildlife managers seeking to mitigate the impacts of energy development across the western United States. We compiled a geodatabase of published and unpublished Golden Eagle prey data in order to characterize spatial and temporal patterns in prey use, investigate ecological relationships between Golden Eagles and prey communities, and inform conservation planning. We analyzed 30 studies identifying 42,841 individual prey during the breeding season from 1954-2015 and found principal prey groups differed among western ecosystems. Dietary breadth varied from 1.36 to 12.27, with lower breadth associated with desert and shrub-steppe ecosystems and higher with mountain ranges and the Columbia Plateau. Diets in the Wyoming Basin were characterized by high frequencies of leporids while predation on sciurids varied (0–45%) among studies. Analysis of long-term data from southwest Idaho indicated prey switching from leporid to sciurid species in response to habitat change caused by wildfire and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) invasion. Similarly, Golden Eagles in Central Utah fed more frequently on rock squirrel (Otospermophilus variegatus) in years with decreased use of jackrabbits (Lepus spp.) and cottontails (Sylvilagus spp.). These results support the conclusion that Golden Eagles are opportunistic generalist predators that specialize on locally available prey species. Spatial and temporal variations in Golden Eagle diet likely reflect changes in prey community structure in response to environmental factors, such as drought and invasive species, that affect prey species abundance, distribution, and availability. A diverse prey base could be important for allowing Golden Eagles to shift among alternative prey in response to changing conditions. Land management practices that support or restore shrub-steppe ecosystem diversity should therefore benefit Golden Eagles. More information is needed on diet during the nonbreeding season to determine what food resources, such as carrion, are important for over-winter survival.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Bats are an important component of ecosystems worldwide. Unfortunately, many bat species have undergone large population declines and are faced with increasing risk of extinction. Northern Long-eared Bat (NLEB) was petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act in 2010. The primary factor threating the species cited in the petition was the large impact of White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) to the species throughout a large portion of its range in eastern North America. In April 2015, USFWS determined the species warranted threatened species status. In Wyoming, the species is limited to the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains of northeastern Wyoming. Basic knowledge of habitat use and associations of NLEB in Wyoming is limited. In 2014, we placed paired acoustic recording devices at spatially balanced random sample locations across the species range in Wyoming. At these sites, we collected extensive habitat data to characterize forest structure. Using these data, we estimated detection probability and occupancy probability of NLEB using a two-step modeling approach. First, we identified the best model for estimating detection probability. Then, using the best detection function and habitat covariates, we identified the best model for estimating occupancy probability. The best detection function for NLEB did not include any covariates, indicating that detection did not vary with the covariates included in our detection models. The estimated detection probability for NLEB was low (p = 0.273; SE = 0.094). The highest ranked occupancy model estimated that NLEB was present at approximately half of potential survey locations (ψ = 0.489; SE = 0.202). This model contained covariates for the density and DBH of live trees and suggests that the probability of occupancy increased with the density and DBH of live trees. This model aligns with our expectations because NLEB is a forest obligate species frequently found in relatively dense forests.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'An approach that can generate sagebrush habitat change estimates for monitoring large-area sagebrush ecosystems has been developed and tested in southwestern Wyoming, USA. This prototype method uses a satellite-based image change detection algorithm and regression models to estimate sub-pixel percentage cover for five sagebrush habitat components: bare ground, herbaceous, litter, sagebrush and shrub. Landsat images from three different months in 1988, 1996 and 2006 were selected to identify potential landscape change during these time periods using change vector (CV) analysis incorporated with an image normalization algorithm. Regression tree (RT) models were used to estimate percentage cover for five components on all change areas identified in 1988 and 1996, using unchanged 2006 baseline data as training for both estimates. Over the entire study area (24 950 km2), a net increase of 98.83 km2, or 0.7%, for bare ground was measured between 1988 and 2006. Over the same period, the other four components had net losses of 20.17 km2, or 0.6%, for herbaceous vegetation; 30.16 km2, or 0.7%, for litter; 32.81 km2, or 1.5%, for sagebrush; and 33.34 km2, or 1.2%, for shrubs. The overall accuracy for shrub vegetation change between 1988 and 2006 was 89.56%. Change patterns within sagebrush habitat components differ spatially and quantitatively from each other, potentially indicating unique responses by these components to disturbances imposed upon them.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Migratory ungulates are often exposed to anthropogenic infrastructure along their migration routes. Understanding the influence of such development on migratory behavior is critical to successful planning and conservation. Impermeable barriers have obvious and detrimental effects to migratory ungulate populations, but the influence of semi‐permeable barriers, where the connectivity of migration habitat is maintained but the migration routes are compromised by anthropogenic development, remains unclear. We evaluated the influence of development on the migratory behavior of individual mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in western Wyoming, USA. We used fine‐scale movement data to evaluate the influence of anthropogenic infrastructure on deer movement rates, stopover use, and fidelity to migration routes for individual animals across multiple seasons and years. Deer avoided human infrastructure when selecting stopover sites. Fidelity to migration routes and stopover areas, as measured by the degree of spatial overlap between years, was not influenced by development, except in one heavily developed area. Our results suggested that deer increased rate of movement, reduced time in stopovers, and shifted stopovers in areas of intense development. In most cases, deer maintained fidelity to migration routes, regardless of development, suggesting that deer mediated exposure to development by altering movement—rates and timing—rather than the routes they traversed. This work adds to a growing number of studies indicating that development can disrupt migratory behavior. Understanding how different types and intensities of development influence migration can help inform land‐use planning and conservation of migratory ungulates.',\n",

We compared small stream drainages in a semiarid landscape with varying amounts of disturbance from oil and natural gas development to examine potential effects of this development on surface water quality. We used physical, chemical, and biological approaches to assess water quality and found several potential avenues of degradation. Surface disturbance likely contributed to elevated suspended sediment concentrations and spill history likely led to elevated stream polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations. In combination, these environmental stressors could explain the loss of aquatic macroinvertebrate taxon at sites highly affected by oil and natural gas development.

       "  'abstract': 'As habitat loss and fragmentation increase across ungulate ranges, identifying and prioritizing migration routes for conservation has taken on new urgency. Here we present a general framework using the Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) that: (1) provides a probabilistic estimate of the migration routes of a sampled population, (2) distinguishes between route segments that function as stopover sites vs. those used primarily as movement corridors, and (3) prioritizes routes for conservation based upon the proportion of the sampled population that uses them. We applied this approach to a migratory mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) population in a pristine area of southwest Wyoming, USA, where 2000 gas wells and 1609 km of pipelines and roads have been proposed for development. Our analysis clearly delineated where migration routes occurred relative to proposed development and provided guidance for on‐the‐ground conservation efforts. Mule deer migration routes were characterized by a series of stopover sites where deer spent most of their time, connected by movement corridors through which deer moved quickly. Our findings suggest management strategies that differentiate between stopover sites and movement corridors may be warranted. Because some migration routes were used by more mule deer than others, proportional level of use may provide a reasonable metric by which routes can be prioritized for conservation. The methods we outline should be applicable to a wide range of species that inhabit regions where migration routes are threatened or poorly understood.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Conversion of native winter range into producing gas fields can affect the habitat selection and distribution patterns of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Understanding how levels of human activity influence mule deer is necessary to evaluate mitigation measures and reduce indirect habitat loss to mule deer on winter ranges with natural gas development. We examined how 3 types of well pads with varying levels of vehicle traffic influenced mule deer habitat selection in western Wyoming during the winters of 2005–2006 and 2006–2007. Well pad types included producing wells without a liquids gathering system (LGS), producing wells with a LGS, and well pads with active directional drilling. We used 36,699 Global Positioning System locations collected from a sample (n \\u200a=\\u200a 31) of adult (>1.5-yr-old) female mule deer to model probability of use as a function of traffic level and other habitat covariates. We treated each deer as the experimental unit and developed a population-level resource selection function for each winter by averaging coefficients among models for individual deer. Model coefficients and predictive maps for both winters suggested that mule deer avoided all types of well pads and selected areas further from well pads with high levels of traffic. Accordingly, impacts to mule deer could probably be reduced through technology and planning that minimizes the number of well pads and amount of human activity associated with them. Our results suggested that indirect habitat loss may be reduced by approximately 38–63% when condensate and produced water are collected in LGS pipelines rather than stored at well pads and removed via tanker trucks. The LGS seemed to reduce long-term (i.e., production phase) indirect habitat loss to wintering mule deer, whereas drilling in crucial winter range created a short-term (i.e., drilling phase) increase in deer disturbance and indirect habitat loss. Recognizing how mule deer respond to different types of well pads and traffic regimes may improve the ability of agencies and industry to estimate cumulative effects and quantify indirect habitat losses associated with different development scenarios.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Identifying the elements within human-altered landscapes most associated with population and community changes is critical for conservation and management of sensitive species. We investigated which features of habitat change from natural gas development best explained the density of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), an important nest predator of declining sagebrush-obligate songbirds. During 2014–2016, we quantified the spatial extent of habitat change (well pads, roads, and reclaimed areas [i.e., reseeded soils]) surrounding 12 sites spanning two natural gas fields in Wyoming, USA. We further tested whether the altered plant communities within reclaimed areas provided benefits to deer mice, by assessing multiple fitness indices. Deer mouse density increased with surrounding reclaimed area. Powder tracking and dietary analyses confirmed that mice moved through and consumed plant species found exclusively within reclaimed areas. Concomitant fitness metrics of mice, however, were neutrally or negatively related to the amount of surrounding reclaimed area. Mice therefore did not derive any apparent fitness benefits associated with living near reclaimed areas, despite the presence of novel food resources, indicating that increased abundance may be a product of mice dispersing toward reseeded soils. Our study contributes mechanistic insights into the complexities of how human-induced changes to landscapes can influence community dynamics. Minimizing total habitat disturbed during construction, expediting reclamation practices, and using only native and regionally-local seed mixes would likely help minimize increases in synanthropic rodent predators within energy fields. More efficient restoration of disturbed habitat, moreover, may help ameliorate altered predator-prey relationships that affect the success of sensitive species.',\n",

Salinity tolerance has been hypothesized as the predominant factor affecting frequency of these species. This study compared relative salinity tolerance of these species, and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa). Plants were evaluated in hydroponics, eliminating the confounding effects of drought, for 28 days at 0, 150, 200, 300, 400, 600, and 800 mmol/L NaCl. Survival, growth, and ion accumulation were determined. Alfalfa and tall wheatgrass shoot mass were reduced to 32% of the control at 150 mmol/L. Forage kochia survived to 600 mmol/L, but mass was reduced at all salinity levels. Halogeton and Gardner's saltbush increased or maintained shoot mass up to 400 mmol/L. Furthermore, both actively accumulated sodium in shoots, indicating that Na+ was the principle ion in osmotic adjustment, whereas, forage kochia exhibited passive (linear) Na+ accumulation as salinity increased. This study confirmed the halophytic nature of these three species, but, moreover, discovered that Gardner's saltbush was as saline tolerant as halogeton, whereas, forage kochia was less tolerant. Therefore, factors other than salinity tolerance drive these species’ differential persistence in saline‐desert ecosystems.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Federal land management agencies provide stewardship over much of the rangelands in the arid and semi-arid western United States, but they often lack data of the proper spatiotemporal resolution and extent needed to assess range conditions and monitor trends. Recent advances in the blending of complementary, remotely sensed data could provide public lands managers with the needed information. We applied the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) to five Landsat TM and concurrent Terra MODIS scenes, and used pixel-based regression and difference image analyses to evaluate the quality of synthetic reflectance and NDVI products associated with semi-arid rangeland. Predicted red reflectance data consistently demonstrated higher accuracy, less bias, and stronger correlation with observed data than did analogous near-infrared (NIR) data. The accuracy of both bands tended to decline as the lag between base and prediction dates increased; however, mean absolute errors (MAE) were typically ≤10%. The quality of area-wide NDVI estimates was less consistent than either spectral band, although the MAE of estimates predicted using early season base pairs were ≤10% throughout the growing season. Correlation between known and predicted NDVI values and agreement with the 1:1 regression line tended to decline as the prediction lag increased. Further analyses of NDVI predictions, based on a 22 June base pair and stratified by land cover/land use (LCLU), revealed accurate estimates through the growing season; however, inter-class performance varied. This work demonstrates the successful application of the STARFM algorithm to semi-arid rangeland; however, we encourage evaluation of STARFM's performance on a per product basis, stratified by LCLU, with attention given to the influence of base pair selection and the impact of the time lag.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Although human influence across rural landscapes is often discussed, interactions between the native, natural systems and human activities are challenging to measure explicitly. We assessed the distribution of introduced, invasive species as related to anthropogenic infrastructure and environmental conditions across southwestern Wyoming. to discern direct correlations as well as covariate influences between land use, land cover, and abundance of invasive plants, and assess the supposition that these features affect surrounding rangeland conditions. Our sample units were 1\\u200a000 m long and extended outward from target features, which included roads, oil and gas well pads, pipelines, power lines, and featureless background sites. Sample sites were distributed across the region using a stratified, random design with a frame that represented features and land-use intensity. In addition to land-use gradients, we captured a representative, but limited, range of variability in climate, soils, geology, topography, and dominant vegetation. Several of these variables proved significant, in conjunction with distance from anthropogenic features, in regression models of invasive plant abundance. We used general linear models to demonstrate and compare associations between invasive plant frequency and Euclidian distance from features, natural logarithm transformed distances (log-linear), and environmental variables which were presented as potential covariates. We expected a steep curvilinear (log or exponential) decline trending towards an asymptote along the axis representing high abundance near features with rapid decrease beyond approximately 50–100 m. Some of the associations we document exhibit this pattern, but we also found some invasive plant distributions that extended beyond our expectations, suggesting a broader distribution than anticipated. Our results provide details that can inform local efforts for management and control of invasive species, and they provide evidence of the different associations between natural patterns and human land use exhibited by nonnative species in this rural setting, such as the indirect effects of humans beyond impact areas.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Regional variations in thickness and facies of clastic sediments are controlled by geographic location within a foreland basin. Preservation of facies is dependent on the original accommodation space available during deposition and ultimately by tectonic modification of the foreland in its postthrusting stages. The preservation of facies within the foreland basin and during the modification stage affects the kinds of hydrocarbon reservoirs that are present.\\n\\nThis is the case for the Cretaceous Mowry Shale and Frontier Formation and equivalent strata in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. Biostratigraphically constrained isopach maps of three intervals within these formations provide a control on eustatic variations in sea level, which allow depositional patterns across dip and along strike to be interpreted in terms of relationship to thrust progression and depositional topography.\\n\\nThe most highly subsiding parts of the Rocky Mountain foreland basin, near the fold and thrust belt to the west, typically contain a low number of coarse-grained sandstone channels but limited sandstone reservoirs. However, where subsidence is greater than sediment supply, the foredeep contains stacked deltaic sandstones, coal, and preserved transgressive marine shales in mainly conformable successions. The main exploration play in this area is currently coalbed gas, but the enhanced coal thickness combined with a Mowry marine shale source rock indicates that a low-permeability, basin-centered play may exist somewhere along strike in a deep part of the basin.\\n\\nIn the slower subsiding parts of the foreland basin, marginal marine and fluvial sandstones are amalgamated and compartmentalized by unconformities, providing conditions for the development of stratigraphic and combination traps, especially in areas of repeated reactivation. Areas of medium accommodation in the most distal parts of the foreland contain isolated marginal marine shoreface and deltaic sandstones that were deposited at or near sea level lowstand and were reworked landward by ravinement and longshore currents by storms creating stratigraphic or combination traps enclosed with marine shale seals.\\n\\nPaleogeographic reconstructions are used to show exploration fairways of the different play types present in the Laramide-modified, Cretaceous foreland basin. Existing oil and gas fields from these plays show a relatively consistent volume of hydrocarbons, which results from the partitioning of facies within the different parts of the foreland basin.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Climate change may represent the greatest future risk to the sagebrush ecosystem. Improved ways to quantify and monitor gradual change resulting from climate influences in this ecosystem are vital to its future management. For this research, the change over time of five continuous field cover components including bare ground, herbaceous, litter, sagebrush, and shrub were measured on the ground and by satellite across six seasons and four years. Ground-measured litter and herbaceous cover exhibited the highest variation annually and herbaceous cover the highest variation seasonally. Correlation of ground measurements to corresponding remote-sensing predictions indicated that annual predictions tracked ground measurements more closely than seasonal ones, and QuickBird predictions tracked ground measurements more closely than Landsat predictions. When annual linear slope values from ground plots and sensor predictions were correlated by component, the direction of ground-measured change was tracked better with QuickBird components than with Landsat components. Component predictions were correlated to annual and seasonal DAYMET precipitation. QuickBird components on average had the best response to precipitation patterns, followed by Landsat components. Overall, these results demonstrate the ability of sagebrush ecosystem components as predicted by regression trees to incrementally measure changing components of a sagebrush ecosystem.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sagebrush ecosystems in North America have experienced extensive degradation since European settlement. Further degradation continues from exotic invasive plants, altered fire frequency, intensive grazing practices, oil and gas development, and climate change – adding urgency to the need for ecosystem-wide understanding. Remote sensing is often identified as a key information source to facilitate ecosystem-wide characterization, monitoring, and analysis; however, approaches that characterize sagebrush with sufficient and accurate local detail across large enough areas to support this paradigm are unavailable. We describe the development of a new remote sensing sagebrush characterization approach for the state of Wyoming, U.S.A. This approach integrates 2.4 m QuickBird, 30 m Landsat TM, and 56 m AWiFS imagery into the characterization of four primary continuous field components including percent bare ground, percent herbaceous cover, percent litter, and percent shrub, and four secondary components including percent sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), percent big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), percent Wyoming sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Wyomingensis), and shrub height using a regression tree. According to an independent accuracy assessment, primary component root mean square error (RMSE) values ranged from 4.90 to 10.16 for 2.4 m QuickBird, 6.01 to 15.54 for 30 m Landsat, and 6.97 to 16.14 for 56 m AWiFS. Shrub and herbaceous components outperformed the current data standard called LANDFIRE, with a shrub RMSE value of 6.04 versus 12.64 and a herbaceous component RMSE value of 12.89 versus 14.63. This approach offers new advancements in sagebrush characterization from remote sensing and provides a foundation to quantitatively monitor these components into the future.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Global energy demands continue to result in new and emerging sources of anthropogenic disturbance to populations and systems. Here, we assessed the influence of natural gas development on a critical component of fitness (nest survival) for Brewer’s sparrow (Spizella breweri), sagebrush sparrow (Artemisiospiza nevadensis), and sage thrasher (Oreoscoptes montanus), three species of sagebrush-obligate songbirds that are of conservation concern, and assessed the efficacy of a commonly used index of oil and gas development intensity (well density) for estimating habitat transformation and predicting species’ responses. During 2008–2009 and 2011–2012 we monitored 926 nests within two natural gas fields in western Wyoming, USA. We calculated landscape metrics (habitat loss, amount of edge, patch shape complexity, and mean patch size) to identify the aspect of landscape transformation most captured by well density. Well density was most positively associated with the amount of sagebrush habitat loss within 1 square kilometer. Nest survival was relatively invariant with respect to well density for all three species. In contrast, nest survival rates of all three species generally decreased with surrounding habitat loss due to energy development. Thus, although well density and habitat loss were strongly correlated, well density resulted in overly conservative estimates of nest survival probability. Our results emphasize the importance of careful evaluation of the appropriateness of particular indices for quantifying the effects of human-induced habitat change. For managers concerned about the effects of natural gas development or similar forms of human land use to co-occurring breeding birds, we recommend minimizing the amount of associated habitat conversion.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Prioritizing habitats for conservation is a challenging task, particularly for species with fluctuating populations and seasonally dynamic habitat needs. Although the use of resource selection models to identify and prioritize habitat for conservation is increasingly common, their ability to characterize important long-term habitats for dynamic populations are variable. To examine how habitats might be prioritized differently if resource selection was directly and dynamically linked with population fluctuations and movement limitations among seasonal habitats, we constructed a spatially explicit individual-based model for a dramatically fluctuating population requiring temporally varying resources. Using greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in Wyoming as a case study, we used resource selection function maps to guide seasonal movement and habitat selection, but emergent population dynamics and simulated movement limitations modified long-term habitat occupancy. We compared priority habitats in RSF maps to long-term simulated habitat use. We examined the circumstances under which the explicit consideration of movement limitations, in combination with population fluctuations and trends, are likely to alter predictions of important habitats. In doing so, we assessed the future occupancy of protected areas under alternative population and habitat conditions. Habitat prioritizations based on resource selection models alone predicted high use in isolated parcels of habitat and in areas with low connectivity among seasonal habitats. In contrast, results based on more biologically-informed simulations emphasized central and connected areas near high-density populations, sometimes predicted to be low selection value. Dynamic models of habitat use can provide additional biological realism that can extend, and in some cases, contradict habitat use predictions generated from short-term or static resource selection analyses. The explicit inclusion of population dynamics and movement propensities via spatial simulation modeling frameworks may provide an informative means of predicting long-term habitat use, particularly for fluctuating populations with complex seasonal habitat needs. Importantly, our results indicate the possible need to consider habitat selection models as a starting point rather than the common end point for refining and prioritizing habitats for protection for cyclic and highly variable populations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Oil and natural gas development in the Intermountain West region of North America has expanded over the last 2 decades, primarily within sagebrush dominated landscapes. Although the effects of energy development on high‐profile game species such as the greater sage‐grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have been documented, studies examining responses of non‐game birds are lacking. Simultaneously, many songbirds that breed within sagebrush steppe habitats have shown range‐wide population declines that are likely due to widespread habitat loss and alteration. We evaluated songbird abundance and species richness across gradients of oil and natural gas development intensity, as indexed by well density, at 3 energy fields (2 natural gas and 1 oil) in the Upper Green River Basin, Wyoming, USA during 2008–2009. While simultaneously accounting for important habitat attributes, increased well density was associated with significant decreases in Brewer's sparrow (Spizella breweri) and sage sparrow (Amphispiza belli) abundance, particularly in the Jonah natural gas field. Vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) were also negatively influenced by increased well density. Horned larks (Eremophila alpestris) increased with well density in the Pinedale Anticline natural gas field, and sage thrashers (Oreoscoptes montanus) showed no response to energy development. Species richness was not significantly affected by well density. Results suggest that regional declines of some songbird species, especially sagebrush‐obligates, may be exacerbated by increased energy development. Understanding the specific mechanisms underlying responses to energy development is an important next step and will aid land managers in the development of effective mitigation and management strategies for the maintenance of stable bird communities in sagebrush habitat. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Species distribution models are an important component of natural-resource conservation planning efforts. Independent, external evaluation of their accuracy is important before they are used in management contexts. We evaluated the classification accuracy of two species distribution models designed to predict the distribution of pygmy rabbit Brachylagus idahoensis habitat in southwestern Wyoming, USA. The Nature Conservancy model was deductive and based on published information and expert opinion, whereas the Wyoming Natural Diversity Database model was statistically derived using historical observation data. We randomly selected 187 evaluation survey points throughout southwestern Wyoming in areas predicted to be habitat and areas predicted to be nonhabitat for each model. The Nature Conservancy model correctly classified 39 of 77 (50.6%) unoccupied evaluation plots and 65 of 88 (73.9%) occupied plots for an overall classification success of 63.3%. The Wyoming Natural Diversity Database model correctly classified 53 of 95 (55.8%) unoccupied plots and 59 of 88 (67.0%) occupied plots for an overall classification success of 61.2%. Based on 95% asymptotic confidence intervals, classification success of the two models did not differ. The models jointly classified 10.8% of the area as habitat and 47.4% of the area as nonhabitat, but were discordant in classifying the remaining 41.9% of the area. To evaluate how anthropogenic development affected model predictive success, we surveyed 120 additional plots among three density levels of gas-field road networks. Classification success declined sharply for both models as road-density level increased beyond 5 km of roads per km-squared area. Both models were more effective at predicting habitat than nonhabitat in relatively undeveloped areas, and neither was effective at accounting for the effects of gas-energy-development road networks. Resource managers who wish to know the amount of pygmy rabbit habitat present in an area or wanting to direct gas-drilling efforts away from pygmy rabbit habitat may want to consider both models in an ensemble manner, where more confidence is placed in mapped areas (i.e., pixels) for which both models agree than for areas where there is model disagreement.',\n",

In 2011, we began collecting three years of survey data to examine the relationship between gas field development density and pygmy rabbit site occupancy patterns on four major Wyoming gas fields (Continental Divide–Creston–Blue Gap, Jonah, Moxa Arch, Pinedale Anticline Project Area). We surveyed 120 plots across four gas fields, with plots distributed across the density gradient of gas well pads on each field. In a 1 km radius around the center of each plot, we measured the area covered by each of 10 gas field infrastructure elements and by shrub cover using 2012 National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery. We then modeled the relationship between gas field elements, pygmy rabbit presence, and two indices of pygmy rabbit abundance. Gas field infrastructure elements—specifically buried utility corridors and a complex of gas well pads, adjacent disturbed areas, and well pad access roads—were negatively correlated with pygmy rabbit presence and abundance indices, with sharp declines apparent after approximately 2% of the area consisted of gas field infrastructure. We conclude that pygmy rabbits in southwestern Wyoming may be sensitive to gas field development at levels similar to those observed for greater sage‐grouse, and may suffer local population declines at lower levels of development than are allowed in existing plans and policies designed to conserve greater sage‐grouse by limiting the surface footprint of energy development. Buried utilities, gas well pads, areas adjacent to well pads, and well pad access roads had the strongest negative correlation with pygmy rabbit presence and abundance. Minimizing the surface footprint of these elements may reduce negative impacts of gas energy development on pygmy rabbits.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Foreseeable natural gas development in southwestern Wyoming has the potential to increase sagebrush fragmentation and risks to resident wildlife species. The ability to balance future development with conservation goals, however, is enhanced by advances in directional-drilling technologies that use multiple wells per pad and produce less surface disturbance than conventional drilling methods. To evaluate the conservation potential of this technology, I developed an energy footprint model that simulates well, pad, and road patterns for oil and gas recovery options that vary in well types (vertical and directional) and number of wells per pad and use simulation results to quantify physical and wildlife-habitat impacts. I applied the model to assess tradeoffs among 10 conventional and directional-drilling scenarios in a natural gas field in southwestern Wyoming. Scenarios spanned a gradient in the number of vertical and directional wells, and in number of pads (2000 to 250), but all extracted the same amount of gas over a 15-year period. Reducing pad numbers with directional-drilling technology reduced surface disturbance area and impacts on spatially extensive habitats (48–96% of study area) such as sagebrush-obligate songbird habitat, elk winter range, and sagebrush core area. Impacts declined for spatially restricted mule deer migration corridors (24% of study area) and greater sage-grouse leks until energy infrastructure densities within corridors and near leks were similar to the initial landscape. Scenario simulations and tradeoff assessments such as illustrated in this study are intended to help decision-makers identify development designs that best achieve both energy and conservation goals.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Animal species across multiple taxa demonstrate multi-annual population cycles, which have long been of interest to ecologists. Correlated population cycles between species that do not share a predator–prey relationship are particularly intriguing and challenging to explain. We investigated annual population trends of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus sp.) across Wyoming to explore the possibility of correlations between unrelated species, over multiple cycles, very large spatial areas, and relatively southern latitudes in terms of cycling species. We analyzed sage-grouse lek counts and annual hunter harvest indices from 1982 to 2007. We show that greater sage-grouse, currently listed as warranted but precluded under the US Endangered Species Act, and cottontails have highly correlated cycles (r = 0.77). We explore possible mechanistic hypotheses to explain the synchronous population cycles. Our research highlights the importance of control populations in both adaptive management and impact studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the functional value of these indices (lek counts and hunter harvest) for tracking broad-scale fluctuations in the species. This level of highly correlated long-term cycling has not previously been documented between two non-related species, over a long time-series, very large spatial scale, and within more southern latitudes.',\n",

Nonetheless, empirical support for the Green Wave Hypothesis is mixed, and a framework for understanding variation in surfing is lacking. In a population of migratory mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), 31% surfed plant phenology in spring as well as a theoretically perfect surfer, and 98% surfed better than random. Green‐wave surfing varied among individuals and was unrelated to age or energetic state. Instead, the greenscape, which we define as the order, rate and duration of green‐up along migratory routes, was the primary factor influencing surfing. Our results indicate that migratory routes are more than a link between seasonal ranges, and they provide an important, but often overlooked, foraging habitat. In addition, the spatiotemporal configuration of forage resources that propagate along migratory routes shape animal movement and presumably, energy gains during migration.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This report was prepared at the request of the U.S. Department of the Interior and is a compilation and summary of published scientific studies that evaluate the influence of anthropogenic activities and infrastructure on Greater Sage-Grouse(Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter, sage-grouse) populations. The purpose of this report is to provide a convenient reference for land managers and others who are working to develop biologically relevant and socioeconomically practical buffer distances around sage-grouse habitats. The framework for this summary includes (1) addressing the potential effects of anthropogenic land use and disturbances on sage-grouse populations, (2) providing ecologically based interpretations of evidence from the scientific literature, and (3) informing implementation of conservation buffers around sage-grouse communal breeding locations—known as leks.\\n\\nWe do not make specific management recommendations but instead provide summarized information, citations, and interpretation of findings available in scientific literature. We also recognize that because of variation in populations, habitats, development patterns, social context, and other factors, for a particular disturbance type, there is no single distance that is an appropriate buffer for all populations and habitats across the sage-grouse range. Thus, we report values for distances upon which protective, conservation buffers might be based, in conjunction with other considerations. We present this information for six categories of land use or disturbance typically found in land-use plans which are representative of the level of definition available in the scientific literature: surface disturbance (multiple causes; immediate and cumulative influences); linear features (roads); energy development (oil, gas, wind, and solar); tall structures (electrical, communication, and meteorological); low structures (fences and buildings); and activities (noise and related disruptions). Minimum and maximum distances for observed effects found in the scientific literature, as well as a distance range for possible conservation buffers based on interpretation of multiple sources, expert knowledge of the authors regarding affected areas, and the distribution of birds around leks are provided for each of the six categories These interpreted values for buffer distances are an attempt to balance the extent of protected areas with multiple land-use requirements using estimates of the distribution of sage-grouse habitat. Conservation efforts may then focus on the overlap between potential effect zone and important habitats. We provide a brief discussion of some of the most relevant literature for each category. References associated with the minimum and maximum values are identified in the References Cited section with corresponding symbols.\\n\\nDistances in this report reflect radii around lek locations because these locations are typically (although not universally) known, and management plans often refer to these locations. Lek sites are most representative of breeding habitats, but their locations are focal points within populations, and as such, protective buffers around lek sites can offer a useful solution for identifying and conserving seasonal habitats required by sage-grouse throughout their life cycle. However, knowledge of local and regional patterns of seasonal habitat use may improve conservation of those important areas, especially regarding the distribution and utilization of nonbreeding season habitats (which may be underrepresented in lek-based designations).',\n",

Selected samples also were analyzed for gross alpha radioactivity, gross beta radioactivity, radon, tritium, gasoline range organics, diesel range organics, dissolved hydrocarbon gases (methane, ethene, and ethane), and wastewater compounds.\\n\\nWater-quality measurements and concentrations in some samples exceeded numerous U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) drinking water standards. Physical characteristics and constituents that exceeded EPA Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) in some samples were arsenic, selenium, nitrite, nitrate, gross alpha activity, and uranium. Total coliforms and Escherichia coli in some samples exceeded EPA Maximum Contaminant Level Goals. Measurements of pH and turbidity and concentrations of chloride, sulfate, fluoride, dissolved solids, aluminum, iron, and manganese exceeded EPA Secondary Maximum Contaminant Levels in some samples. Radon concentrations in some samples exceeded the alternative MCL proposed by the EPA. Molybdenum and boron concentrations in some samples exceeded EPA Health Advisory Levels.\\n\\nWater-quality measurements and concentrations also exceeded numerous Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) groundwater standards. Physical characteristics and constituents that exceeded WDEQ Class I domestic groundwater standards in some samples were measurements of pH and concentrations of chloride, sulfate, dissolved solids, iron, manganese, boron, selenium, nitrite, and nitrate. Measurements of pH and concentrations of chloride, sulfate, dissolved solids, aluminum, iron, manganese, boron, and selenium exceeded WDEQ Class II agriculture groundwater standards in some samples. Measurements of pH and concentrations of sulfate, dissolved solids, aluminum, boron, and selenium exceeded WDEQ Class III livestock groundwater standards in some samples.

       "  'abstract': 'Drought has long been recognized as a driving mechanism in the forests of western North America and drought-induced mortality has been documented across genera in recent years. Given the frequency of these events are expected to increase in the future, understanding patterns of mortality and plant response to severe drought is important to resource managers. Drought can affect the functional, physiological, structural, and demographic properties of forest ecosystems. Remote sensing studies have documented changes in forest properties due to direct and indirect effects of drought; however, few studies have addressed this at local scales needed to characterize highly heterogeneous ecosystems in the forest-shrubland ecotone. We analyzed a 22-year Landsat time series (1985–2012) to determine changes in forest in an area that experienced a relatively dry decade punctuated by two years of extreme drought. We assessed the relationship between several vegetation indices and field measured characteristics (e.g. plant area index and canopy gap fraction) and applied these indices to trend analysis to uncover the location, direction and timing of change. Finally, we assessed the interaction of climate and topography by forest functional type. The Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), a measure of canopy water content, had the strongest correlation with short-term field measures of plant area index (R2 = 0.64) and canopy gap fraction (R2 = 0.65). Over the entire time period, 25% of the forested area experienced a significant (p-value < 0.05) negative trend in NDMI, compared to less than 10% in a positive trend. Coniferous forests were more likely to be associated with a negative NDMI trend than deciduous forest. Forests on southern aspects were least likely to exhibit a negative trend while north aspects were most prevalent. Field plots with a negative trend had a lower live density, and higher amounts of standing dead and down trees compared to plots with no trend. Our analysis identifies spatially explicit patterns of long-term trends anchored with ground based evidence to highlight areas of forest that are resistant, persistent or vulnerable to severe drought. The results provide a long-term perspective for the resource management of this area and can be applied to similar ecosystems throughout western North America.',\n",

The Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative is a long-term science-based effort to ensure southwestern Wyoming’s wildlife and habitat remain viable in areas facing development pressure.  Wyoming encompasses some of the highest quality wildlife habitats in the Intermountain West.  At the same time, this region is an important source of natural gas. Using Geographic Information System technology, energy data pertinent to the conservation decision-making process have been assembled to show historical oil and gas exploration and production in southwestern Wyoming. In addition to historical data, estimates of undiscovered oil and gas are included from the 2002 U.S. Geological Survey National Assessment of Oil and Gas in the Southwestern Wyoming Province. This report is meant to facilitate the integration of existing data with new knowledge and technologies to analyze energy resources development and to assist in habitat conservation planning. The well and assessment data can be accessed and shared among many different clients including, but not limited to, an online web-service for scientists and resource managers engaged in the Initiative.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Wyoming has led the nation as the producer of uranium ore since 1995 and contains the largest reserves of any state. Approximately one third of Wyoming’s total production came from deposits in, or immediately adjacent to, the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) study area in the southwestern corner of the state including all of Carbon, Lincoln, Sublette, Sweetwater, Uinta, and parts of southern Fremont Counties. Conventional open-pit and underground mining methods were employed in the study area until the early 1990s. Since the early 1990s, all uranium mining has been by in-situ recovery (also called in-situ leach). It is estimated that statewide remaining resources of 141,000 tonnes of uranium are about twice the 84,000 tonnes of uranium that the state has already produced.\\n\\nAn evaluation of the mineral commodities present in the WLCI study area that may have a role in the development of southwest Wyoming includes uranium. The WLCI study area contains five uranium mineralized areas: Ketchum Buttes, Poison Basin, Shirley Basin, the southern part of Crooks Gap–Green Mountain, and most of Great Divide Basin. Mineralized areas described in the report and outlined on an accompanying map are based on the presence of either contiguous claim blocks, continuous mineralization adjacent to prospective uranium properties, suggestions of mineralization based on site entries in the U.S. Geological Survey’s Mineral Resources Data System (MRDS), or extension of geologic host units or structures. Mineralized areas are not the same as mining districts: the latter have defined administrative boundaries.\\n\\nIn the WLCI study area, all uranium areas except Poison Basin and Ketchum Buttes contain roll-front deposits in Eocene (56–34 Ma) sedimentary rocks. Tabular sandstone-hosted uranium deposits are also recognized within the study area.',\n",

Records were located for 3,282 wells in the upper Green River Basin, which includes the U.S. Geological Survey study area and the proposed Normally Pressured Lance natural gas development project area. Records for 2,713 upper Green River Basin wells were determined to be unique (not duplicated) and to have a Wyoming State Engineers Office permit. Further, 376 of these wells were within the U.S. Geological Survey Normally Pressured Lance study area. Of the 376 wells in the U.S. Geological Survey Normally Pressured Lance study area, 141 well records had sufficient documentation, such as well depth, open interval, geologic log, and depth to water, to meet many, but not always all, established monitor well criteria. Efforts were made to locate each of the 141 wells and to document their current condition. Field crews were able to locate 121 of the wells, and the remaining 20 wells either were not located as described, or had been abandoned and the site reclaimed. Of the 121 wells located, 92 were found to meet established monitor well criteria. Results of the field efforts during May through September 2012, and specific physical characteristics of the 92 wells, are presented in this report.',\n",

For each turbine, this report contains information about the following: potential megawatt output, rotor diameter, hub height, rotor height, land ownership, county, wind farm power capacity, the number of units currently associated with its wind farm, the wind turbine manufacturer and model, the wind farm developer, the owner of the wind farm, the current purchaser of power from the wind farm, the year the wind farm went online, and the status of its operation. Some attributes are estimates based on information that was obtained through the American Wind Energy Association and miscellaneous online reports. The locations are derived from August 2009 true-color aerial photographs made by the National Agriculture Imagery Program; the photographs have a positional accuracy of approximately ?5 meters. The location of wind turbines under construction during the development of this data set will likely be less accurate than the location of turbines already completed. The original purpose for developing the data presented here was to evaluate the effect of wind energy development on seasonal habitat used by greater sage-grouse. Additionally, these data will provide a planning tool for the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative Science Team and for other wildlife- and habitat-related projects underway at the U.S. Geological Survey's Fort Collins Science Center. Specifically, these data will be used to quantify disturbance of the landscape related to wind energy as well as quantifying indirect disturbances to flora and fauna. This data set was developed for the 2010 project 'Seasonal predictive habitat models for greater sage-grouse in Wyoming.' This project's spatially explicit seasonal distribution models of sage-grouse in Wyoming will provide resource managers with tools for conservation planning. These specific data are being used for assessing the effect of disturbance resulting from wind energy development within Wyoming on sage-grouse populations.\",\n",

Specifically, we compared how each mapped the area of and classified the disturbance features present on each of three remotely sensed images, including 30-meter-resolution Landsat, 10-meter-resolution SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre), and 0.6-meter resolution pan-sharpened QuickBird scenes. Feature Extraction mapped the spatial area of disturbance features most accurately on the Landsat and QuickBird imagery, while hand digitization was most accurate on the SPOT imagery. Footprint non-overlap error was smallest on the Feature Analyst map of the Landsat imagery, the hand digitization map of the SPOT imagery, and the Feature Extraction map of the QuickBird imagery. When evaluating feature classification success against a set of ground-truthed control points, Feature Analyst, Feature Extraction, and hand digitization classified features with similar success on the QuickBird and SPOT imagery, while eCognition classified features poorly relative to the other methods. All maps derived from Landsat imagery classified disturbance features poorly. Using the hand digitized QuickBird data as a reference and making pixel-by-pixel comparisons, Feature Extraction classified features best overall on the QuickBird imagery, and Feature Analyst classified features best overall on the SPOT and Landsat imagery. Based on the entire suite of tasks we evaluated, Feature Extraction performed best overall on the Landsat and QuickBird imagery, while hand digitization performed best overall on the SPOT imagery, and eCognition performed worst overall on all three images. Error rates for both area measurements and feature classification were prohibitively high on Landsat imagery, while QuickBird was time and cost prohibitive for mapping large spatial extents. The SPOT imagery produced map products that were far more accurate than Landsat and did so at a far lower cost than QuickBird imagery. Consideration of degree of map accuracy required, costs associated with image acquisition, software, operator and computation time, and tradeoffs in the form of spatial extent versus resolution should all be considered when evaluating which combination of imagery and information-extraction method might best serve any given land use mapping project. When resources permit, attaining imagery that supports the highest classification and measurement accuracy possible is recommended.\",\n",

In southwestern Wyoming, expanding energy and mineral development, urban growth, and other changes in land use over recent decades, combined with landscape-scale drivers such as climate change and invasive species, have presented compelling challenges to resource managers and a diverse group of Federal, State, industry, and non-governmental organizations, as well as citizen stakeholders. To address these challenges, the WLCI was established as a collaborative forum and interagency partnership to develop and implement science-based conservation actions. About a decade after being established, this report documents the establishment and history of the WLCI, focusing on the path to success of the initiative and providing insights and details that may be useful in developing similar partnerships in other locations. Not merely retrospective, the elements of the WLCI that are presented herein are still in play, still evolving, and still contributing to the resolution of compelling conservation challenges in the Western United States.\\n\\nThe U.S. Geological Survey has developed many successful longstanding partnerships, of which the WLCI is one example.\\n\\n“As the Nation’s largest water, earth, and biological science and civilian mapping agency, the U.S. Geological Survey collects, monitors, analyzes, and provides scientific understanding about natural resource conditions, issues, and problems.

       "  'abstract': 'Population ecologists have long recognized the importance of ecological scale in understanding processes that guide observed demographic patterns for wildlife species. However, directly incorporating spatial and temporal scale into monitoring strategies that detect whether trajectories are driven by local or regional factors is challenging and rarely implemented. Identifying the appropriate scale is critical to the development of management actions that can attenuate or reverse population declines. We describe a novel example of a monitoring framework for estimating annual rates of population change for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) within a hierarchical and spatially nested structure. Specifically, we conducted Bayesian analyses on a 17-year dataset (2000–2016) of lek counts in Nevada and northeastern California to estimate annual rates of population change, and compared trends across nested spatial scales. We identified leks and larger scale populations in immediate need of management, based on the occurrence of two criteria: (1) crossing of a destabilizing threshold designed to identify significant rates of population decline at a particular nested scale; and (2) crossing of decoupling thresholds designed to identify rates of population decline at smaller scales that decouple from rates of population change at a larger spatial scale. This approach establishes how declines affected by local disturbances can be separated from those operating at larger scales (for example, broad-scale wildfire and region-wide drought). Given the threshold output from our analysis, this adaptive management framework can be implemented readily and annually to facilitate responsive and effective actions for sage-grouse populations in the Great Basin. The rules of the framework can also be modified to identify populations responding positively to management action or demonstrating strong resilience to disturbance. Similar hierarchical approaches might be beneficial for other species occupying landscapes with heterogeneous disturbance and climatic regimes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) population declines may be caused by range-wide degradation of sagebrush (woody Artemisia spp.) steppe ecosystems. Understanding how greater sage-grouse use the landscape is essential for successful management. We assessed greater sage-grouse habitat selection on a landscape level in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) and radio-collared sage-grouse to compare habitat used and the total available landscape. Greater sage-grouse selected mountain big sagebrush (A. tridentata var. vaseyana) communities or mixed mountain big sagebrush–antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) communities and avoided low-sagebrush (A. arbuscula) dwarf shrubland. In spring and summer, sage-grouse primarily used sagebrush-dominated habitats on the valley floor and did not concentrate in mesic areas later in the summer as is typical of the species. The diversity of habitats used in winter exceeds that reported in the literature. In winter, Jackson Hole greater sage-grouse moved to hills, where they used various communities in proportion to their availability, including tall deciduous shrublands, cottonwood (Populus angustifolia) stands, exposed hillsides, and aspen (P. tremuloides) stands. Because seasonal habitat selection is not necessarily consistent across populations residing in different landscapes, habitat management should be specific to each population and landscape. This sage-grouse population provides an example that may offer insight into other species with seasonal habitat needs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This is the eighth annual report highlighting U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) science and decision-support activities conducted for the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI). The activities address specific management needs identified by WLCI partner agencies. In 2015, USGS scientists continued 24 WLCI projects in 5 categories: (1) acquiring and analyzing resource-condition data to form a foundation for understanding and monitoring landscape conditions and projecting changes; (2) using new technologies to improve the scope and accuracy of landscape-scale monitoring and assessments, and applying them to monitor indicators of ecosystem conditions and the effectiveness of on-the-ground habitat projects; (3) conducting research to elucidate the mechanisms that drive wildlife and habitat responses to changing land uses; (4) managing and making accessible the large number of databases, maps, and other products being developed; and (5) coordinating efforts among WLCI partners, helping them to use USGS-developed decision-support tools, and integrating WLCI outcomes with future habitat enhancement and research projects. Of the 24 projects, 21 were ongoing, including those that entered new phases or more in-depth lines of inquiry, 2 were new, and 1 was completed.\\n\\nA highlight of 2015 was the WLCI science conference sponsored by the USGS, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service in coordination with the Wyoming chapter of The Wildlife Society. Of 260 participants, 41 were USGS professionals representing 13 USGS science centers, field offices, and Cooperative Wildlife Research Units. Major themes of USGS presentations included using new technologies for developing more efficient research protocols for modeling and monitoring natural resources, researching effects of energy development and other land uses on wildlife species and habitats of concern, and modeling species distributions, population trends, habitat use, and effects of land-use changes. There was also a special session on the effectiveness of Wyoming’s Sage-Grouse Executive Order. Combined, USGS presentations provided WLCI partners with a wealth of information and conservation tools.\\n\\nThe project completed in 2015 yielded an index of important agricultural lands in the WLCI region. The index improves upon existing measures of agricultural productivity and provides planners and managers with additional values to consider when making decisions about land use and conservation actions. The two new projects include an analysis of satellite imagery to quantify sagebrush productivity and mortality, and an evaluation of how groundwater and small streams interact in the upper Green River Basin. Initiated in response to concern among WLCI partners that large areas of sagebrush appear to have died recently, the sagebrush study objectives are to assess effects of these mortality events on overall sagebrush ecosystem productivity, evaluate the feasibility of using satellite imagery to detect patterns in sagebrush mortality over time, and identify factors driving these mortality events. The groundwater-streamflow interaction study is being conducted by hydrologists and fish ecologists to better understand how groundwater-streamflow interactions are affected by energy-resource development and how native fish communities are affected by these factors. Expected outcomes of both new projects will provide WLCI partners with additional information and decision-support tools.\\n\\nHighlights of ongoing science foundation activities included simulations of nine alternative build-out scenarios for oil and gas development and an associated online fact sheet that explains how the simulations were conducted, with an applied example for the Atlantic Rim. Also completed in 2015 was an update of the USGS online inventory of mineral resources data, and publication of a USGS uranium resource survey for the WLCI region. Combined, the outcomes of this work provide decisionmakers and managers with important baseline information for existing and (or) future planning and monitoring efforts.\\n\\nTerrestrial monitoring activities in 2015 emphasized the use of satellite data in combination with other technologies and field data to monitor, assess, and (or) forecast distribution patterns and (or) trends in sagebrush ecosystems, seasonal and migration stopover habitats used by mule deer and elk, and semi-arid aspen woodlands. Several professional papers detailing new monitoring models and results have been published. Combined, this and related work will help managers understand distribution patterns and trends among priority habitats, identify areas in need of restoration or conservation, and monitor the effectiveness of habitat-management actions.\\n\\nAquatic monitoring activities entailed not only the new groundwater-streamflow interaction study already mentioned, but also continued monitoring with streamgages paired with nearby wells in the Green River Basin to assess groundwater effects on streamflow and surface water temperatures. A map that portrays groundwater levels and general direction of flow in the Green River Basin was published as well. Overall, outcomes of USGS hydrological research and monitoring will inform WLCI partners about water resources in the WLCI region and help to explain fish-community responses to energy-resource development.\\n\\nIn 2015, USGS terrestrial wildlife ecologists continued to make crucial strides towards better understanding wildlife species responses to energy-resource development and other land-use changes. This body of research includes six taxa that require or heavily depend on sagebrush habitats: sage-grouse, pygmy rabbits, 3 songbird species, and mule deer. Native fish communities are also being evaluated. Approaches include modeling and mapping wildlife species distributions, abundances, and trends; using satellite and other technologies to track wildlife seasonal movements; conducting successive phases of research that build on the knowledge gained through prior phases to reveal the specific factors or thresholds that drive population- or individual-level responses to changes; and conducting population viability analyses. Additionally, wildlife habitat association models for pygmy rabbit and sage-grouse were combined with the oil and gas build-out scenarios to project species responses to alternative energy development scenarios. Outcomes of the wildlife response research are helping decisionmakers and managers identify specific factors that contribute to species population trends, the potential for spatial overlap between important wildlife habitats and proposed energy-resource development, locations of priority habitats for restoration and conservation, and more.\\n\\nData and WLCI Web site management highlights of 2015 included not only ongoing software upgrades, but also an update of the datasets displayed in two of the online products developed for the WLCI effort: (1) a map of 15,532 oil and natural gas well pad scars and other features associated with oil and gas extraction, and (2) a map of oil and gas, oil shale, uranium, and solar energy production, both for southwestern Wyoming. In addition, a map viewer was developed for a previously published map of coal and wind production in relation to sage-grouse distribution and core management areas in southwestern Wyoming. Combined, these maps place valuable decision-support tools in the hands of WLCI partners.\\n\\nThe USGS coordination efforts on behalf of the WLCI in 2015 included significant work on planning and executing the WLCI science conference. They also included ongoing efforts to support Local Project Development Teams and the WLCI Coordination Team (CT) with developing conservation priorities and strategies, identifying priority areas for future conservation actions, supporting the evaluation and ranking of conservation projects, and evaluating the ways in which proposed habitat projects relate to WLCI priorities. In 2015, the USGS also assisted the WLCI CT with updating the WLCI Conservation Action Plan.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This is the seventh report produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) to detail annual activities conducted by the USGS for addressing specific management needs identified by WLCI partners. In FY2014, there were 26 projects, including a new one that was completed, two others that were also completed, and several that entered new phases or directions. The 26 projects fall into several categories: (1) synthesizing and analyzing existing data to identify current conditions on the landscape and using the data to develop models for projecting past and future landscape conditions; (2) monitoring indicators of ecosystem conditions and the effectiveness of on-the-ground habitat projects; (3) conducting research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying wildlife and habitat responses to changing land uses; (4) managing and making accessible the large number of databases, maps, and other products being developed; and (5) coordinating efforts among WLCI partners, helping them use USGS-developed decision-support tools, and integrating WLCI outcomes with future habitat enhancement and research projects.\\n\\nThe new (completed) project was the development and publication of a public outreach piece for visitors of Fossil Butte National Monument. The final product was a USGS Fact Sheet that capitalized on previously collected elk-monitoring data to interpret the ecology of the Monument’s elk population and the importance of the Monument’s habitats to this highly visible wildlife species. One of the completed projects entailed developing and evaluating a synthetic approach to high-resolution satellite imagery for use in effectiveness monitoring, which culminated in a journal article. The other completed project was a coalescing of two similar tasks under data and information management that pertain to Web application development and the development of outreach and graphic products into a single integrated project that focuses on developing and maintaining/upgrading Web applications and other tools for visualizing, mapping, and using geospatial data.\\n\\nMajor accomplishments for FY2014 included several publications, including Part B of an energy resources map that (with Part A) depicts coal, wind, oil, gas, oil shale, uranium, and solar energy production in the WLCI region. Two published works associated with sage-grouse included a Wildlife Monograph on prioritizing species’ habitats across large landscapes, multiple seasons, and novel areas (using sage-grouse in Wyoming as an example), and a USGS Data Series report that includes both the data used in the habitat-prioritization models and the habitat prioritization models developed for sage-grouse. Our Science Team also published a framework for conducting large, collaborative projects that rely on geospatial data, and a paper that describes the efficacy of fusing satellite data collected at various resolutions for measuring and monitoring vegetation changes. These products are all invaluable tools for maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of managing species of concern, conducting future landscape-scale assessments, and monitoring status and trends of landscape conditions.\\n\\nOther highlights of FY2014 included a renewed effort to gather and analyze wildlife and habitat status and trend data for the WLCI Interagency Monitoring Database (IAMD) to assess long-term trends and cumulative effects associated with land-use and climate changes. Water-monitoring efforts included drilling four new groundwater-monitoring wells in the Green and New Fork River basins near the proposed Normally Pressured Lance Formation energy development, and continued data collection at established water-monitoring sites. Three additional wells were sampled as part of the Wyoming Groundwater Monitoring Network, bringing the total to 19 Network wells sampled in the WLCI region since 2010. Combined, these water-monitoring efforts can help to identify potential changes in water quality or levels that may result from land-use changes. Major terrestrial monitoring accomplishments included processing satellite imagery from 1985−2010 to develop a historical perspective of long-term vegetation changes, which can serve as a basis for monitoring current and future trends in sagebrush steppe. Such data are crucial tools for agencies tasked with sage-grouse management and conservation.\\n\\nThe USGS WLCI Science Team also continued monitoring and testing methods for evaluating WLCI habitat treatments designed to promote aspen regeneration and enhance sage-grouse habitat, and to assess how those treatments influence invasive species distributions and ungulate herbivory. Highlights included analyzing field data collected to elucidate the relationships between sage-grouse habitat use and the proximity of energy infrastructure, and using new instruments to measure productivity responses of aspen woodlands to various factors.\\n\\nNumerous FY2014 accomplishments specifically addressed agency needs to manage and conserve Wyoming’s wildlife species of concern. A pygmy rabbit habitat model and Wyoming distribution map were completed to identify factors associated with rabbit habitat occupancy. Previous work on sage-grouse population dynamics was expanded to better understand the factors that drive long-term viability of sage-grouse populations and to develop a tool that helps to identify key factors limiting sage-grouse persistence in Wyoming. Field work and data analyses continued for elucidating the relationships between sagebrush songbird abundance and productivity, the intensity of energy development, and community dynamics of nest predators. For the mule deer study, mixed mountain shrublands important to migrating and wintering mule deer were mapped and delivered to WLCI partners. Additionally, the relationships between energy development and crucial winter habitat for mule deer were evaluated, and a new phase of work was implemented to better understand relationships between plant phenology and mule deer migration movements. Finally, initial analyses of data collected to evaluate fish-community composition in relation to habitat quality indicate that water quality, as measured by concentrations of hydrocarbons, water temperature, and others parameters, has been diminished in subwatersheds with higher levels of energy development. Overall, the outcomes and products of these wildlife studies contribute significantly to the information and tools needed for addressing effects of land-use changes on Wyoming’s species of concern.\\n\\nFinally, capabilities of the WLCI Web site and the USGS ScienceBase infrastructure were maintained and upgraded to help ensure access to and efficient use of all the WLCI data, products, assessment tools, and outreach materials that have been developed. Of particular note is the completion of three Web applications developed for mapping (1) the 1900−2008 progression of oil and gas development;(2) the predicted distributions of Wyoming’s Species of Greatest Conservation Need; and (3) the locations of coal and wind energy production, sage-grouse distribution and core management areas, and alternative routes for transmission lines within the WLCI region. Collectively, these applications tools provide WLCI planners and managers with powerful tools for better understanding the distributions of wildlife species and potential alternatives for energy development.',\n",

Although energy exploration and development have been taking place in the region since the late 1800s, the pace of development for fossil fuels and renewable energy increased significantly in the early 2000s. This and the associated urban and exurban development are leading to landscape-level environmental and socioeconomic changes that have the potential to diminish wildlife habitat and other natural resources, and the quality of human lives, in Southwest Wyoming.

       "  'abstract': 'This is the ninth annual report highlighting U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) science and decision-support activities conducted for the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI). The activities address specific management needs identified by WLCI partner agencies. In fiscal year (FY) 2016, there were 26 active USGS WLCI science-based projects. Of these 26 projects, one project was new for FY2016, and three were completed by the end of the fiscal year (though final products were still in preparation or review). USGS WLCI projects were grouped under five categories: (1) Baseline Synthesis, (2) Long-Term Monitoring, (3) Effectiveness Monitoring, (4) Mechanistic Studies of Wildlife, and (5) Data and Information Management. Each of these topic areas is designed to address WLCI management needs: identifying key drivers of change, identifying the condition and distribution of key wildlife species and habitats and of species’ habitat requirements, development of an integrated inventory and monitoring strategy, use of emerging technologies and development and testing of innovative methods for maximizing the efficiency and efficacy of monitoring efforts, evaluating the effectiveness of habitat treatment projects, evaluating the responses of wildlife to development, and developing a data clearinghouse and information management framework to support and provide access to results of most USGS WLCI projects.\\n\\nIn FY2016, we assisted with updating the WLCI Conservation Action Plan and associated databases as part of the Comprehensive Assessment, and we also assisted with the Bureau of Land Management 2015 WLCI annual report. By the end of FY2016, we completed or had nearly completed assessments of WLCI energy and mineral resources and had submitted a manuscript on modeled effects of oil and gas development on wildlife to a peer-reviewed journal. We also initiated a study on the effects of wind energy on wildlife in the WLCI region. A USGS circular on WLCI long-term monitoring was in review at the end of the fiscal year, and seven projects monitoring water and vegetation (including changes in sagebrush cover and patterns of sagebrush mortality) continued through the year. USGS scientists continued many projects in FY2016 that evaluate the effectiveness of habitat conservation actions (including sagebrush, cheatgrass, and aspen habitat treatments) and provide tools in support of mechanistic studies of wildlife. In FY2016, USGS scientists, along with university and State partners, continued work on five focal wildlife species/communities (pygmy rabbits [Brachylagus idahoensis], greater sage grouse , mule deer, sagebrush songbirds, and native fish). In FY2016, the USGS Information Management Team presented information to WLCI scientists on how USGS tools and resources can be used to fulfill the requirements of new USGS policies regarding data release, data management, and data visualization.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In cooperation with the Bureau of Land Management, groundwater levels in wells located in the northern Green River Basin in Wyoming, an area of ongoing energy development, were measured by the U.S. Geological Survey from 2010 to 2014. The wells were completed in the uppermost aquifers of the Green River Basin lower Tertiary aquifer system, which is a complex regional aquifer system that provides water to most wells in the area. Except for near perennial streams, groundwater-level altitudes in most aquifers generally decreased with increasing depth, indicating a general downward potential for groundwater movement in the study area. Drilled depth of the wells was observed as a useful indicator of depth to groundwater such that deeper wells typically had a greater depth to groundwater. Comparison of a subset of wells included in this study that had historical groundwater levels that were measured during the 1960s and 1970s and again between 2012 and 2014 indicated that, overall, most of the wells showed a net decline in groundwater levels.\\n\\nThe groundwater-level measurements were used to construct a generalized potentiometric-surface map of the Green River Basin lower Tertiary aquifer system. Groundwater-level altitudes measured in nonflowing and flowing wells used to construct the potentiometric-surface map ranged from 6,451 to 7,307 feet (excluding four unmeasured flowing wells used for contour construction purposes). The potentiometric-surface map indicates that groundwater in the study area generally moves from north to south, but this pattern of flow is altered locally by groundwater divides, groundwater discharge to the Green River, and possibly to a tributary river (Big Sandy River) and two reservoirs (Fontenelle and Big Sandy Reservoirs).',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Elk, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, moose, and bighorn sheep are iconic animals of the American West. These hooved animals, known as ungulates, commonly travel 30–60 miles between seasonal ranges. These migrations between winter and summer ranges are vital for survival and reproduction. As habitat fragmentation continues, the conservation of ungulate migration routes has received considerable attention in the West and across the globe. For example, it is estimated that many ungulate migration routes in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem have already been lost. The traditional migration routes of Wyoming ungulates are threatened by unprecedented levels of energy development and by increasing levels of rural ranchette development (including fences, structures, and roads). In the past, migration corridors have been mapped based primarily on the expert opinions of state game managers, but long-term conservation of Wyoming's ungulate migration routes requires a better understanding of migration ecology and more sophisticated management tools. Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) researchers investigated the migration of a large mule deer herd across the Dad and Wild Horse winter ranges in southwest Wyoming, where 2,000 gas wells and 1,609 kilometers of pipelines and roads have been proposed for development.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Satellite studies of the terrestrial Arctic report increased summer greening and longer overall growing and peak seasons since the 1980s, which increases productivity and the period of carbon uptake. These trends are attributed to increasing air temperatures and reduced snow cover duration in spring and fall. Concurrently, deciduous shrubs are becoming increasingly abundant in tundra landscapes, which may also impact canopy phenology and productivity. Our aim was to determine the influence of greater deciduous shrub abundance on tundra canopy phenology and subsequent impacts on net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) during the growing and peak seasons in the arctic foothills region of Alaska. We compared deciduous shrub‐dominated and evergreen/graminoid‐dominated community‐level canopy phenology throughout the growing season using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We used a tundra plant‐community‐specific leaf area index (LAI) model to estimate LAI throughout the green season and a tundra‐specific NEE model to estimate the impact of greater deciduous shrub abundance and associated shifts in both leaf area and canopy phenology on tundra carbon flux. We found that deciduous shrub canopies reached the onset of peak greenness 13 days earlier and the onset of senescence 3 days earlier compared to evergreen/graminoid canopies, resulting in a 10‐day extension of the peak season. The combined effect of the longer peak season and greater leaf area of deciduous shrub canopies almost tripled the modeled net carbon uptake of deciduous shrub communities compared to evergreen/graminoid communities, while the longer peak season alone resulted in 84% greater carbon uptake in deciduous shrub communities. These results suggest that greater deciduous shrub abundance increases carbon uptake not only due to greater leaf area, but also due to an extension of the period of peak greenness, which extends the period of maximum carbon uptake.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Increased levels of energy development across the intermountain West have created a variety of wildlife and habitat management concerns. Because many of the energy resources in the region occur in shrub-dominated basins (e.g., Powder River, Piceance, Great Divide, and Green River basins), management concerns have focused on native shrub communities and associated species, including mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Two of the more pressing concerns are how mule deer respond when critical habitats (e.g., winter range) are impacted by development and how their migration routes can be identified and prioritized for conservation. To address the first, I examined how three types of natural gas well pads with varying levels of vehicle traffic influenced the winter habitat selection patterns of mule deer in western Wyoming. My results showed that mule deer avoided all types of well pads and selected areas further from well pads that received high levels of traffic. Accordingly, impacts to mule deer could likely be reduced through technology and planning that minimizes the number of well pads and amount of human activity associated with them. To address the migration concerns, I developed a quantitative framework that uses global positioning system (GPS) data and the Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) to: (1) provide a probabilistic estimate of the migration routes of a sampled population, (2) distinguish between route segments that function as stopover sites versus those used primarily as movement corridors, and (3) prioritize routes for conservation based upon the proportion of the sampled population that uses them. Mule deer migration routes were characterized by a series of stopover sites where deer spent most of their time, connected by movement corridors through which deer moved quickly. These findings suggest management strategies that differentiate between stopover sites and movement corridors may be warranted. Because some migration routes were used by more mule deer than others, proportional level of use may provide a reasonable metric by which routes can be prioritized for conservation. Although stopovers appeared to be a prominent feature of mule deer migration routes, the explicit study of stopovers (i.e., stopover ecology) has been limited to avian species. To assess whether stopover ecology was relevant to mule deer, I again used fine-scale GPS data and BBMMs to quantify a suite of stopover characteristics and examine the ecological role of stopovers in the seasonal migrations of mule deer. Mule deer utilized a series of stopover sites in both spring and fall migrations, across a range of migration distances (18-144 km). Overall, mule deer used 1.9 and 1.5 stopovers for every 10 km increase in migration distance during spring and fall migrations, respectively. Stopovers had higher quality forage compared to movement corridors, and forage quality increased with elevation, presumably because of delayed phenology along the altitudinal migration route. Stopovers likely play a key role in the migration strategy of mule deer by allowing them to migrate in concert with vegetative phenology and optimize their foraging during migration. My results suggest stopovers were a critical component in the altitudinal migrations of mule deer and that conservation of stopover sites may improve efforts aimed at sustaining migratory mule deer populations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Oil and natural gas development in the Intermountain West of North America has expanded over the last two decades, primarily within sagebrush (Artemesia spp.) dominated landscapes. Although the effects of energy development on high profile game species such as the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have been documented, studies examining responses of non-game birds are lacking. Simultaneously, many songbirds that breed within sagebrush steppe habitats have shown range-wide population declines that are likely due to widespread habitat loss and alteration. I evaluated songbird abundance, species richness, nest survival and offspring quality across gradients of oil and natural gas development intensity at three energy fields in the Upper Green River Basin, WY, USA during 2008-2009. While simultaneously accounting for important habitat attributes, increased well density was associated with decreases in Brewer's sparrow (Spizella breweri), sage sparrow (Amphispiza belli), and vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) abundance. Horned larks (Eremophila alpestris) increased with well density in the Pinedale Anticline natural gas field. Sage thrashers (Oreoscoptes montanus) showed no response to energy development. Species richness was not significantly affected by well density. Additionally, I tested two alternative hypotheses for why oil and natural gas development influences songbird populations in western Wyoming: increased nest predation or food limitation. The probability of daily nest survival for Brewer's sparrow, sage sparrow, and sage thrasher decreased with greater well densities and increased proximity to well pads, and avian nest predator abundance increased slightly across energy development gradients, supporting a nest predation hypothesis. Additionally, shrub vigor decreased with increasing energy development, which could decrease insect prey availability and impact parental investment in offspring through decreases in clutch size and (or) offspring provisioning. Clutch size did not vary with energy development, but average nestling mass for the sage thrasher (the largest of the study species) decreased significantly with increasing development, lending partial support to the food limitation hypothesis. My results indicate that regional declines of some songbird species, especially sagebrush-obligates, may be exacerbated by increased energy development and suggest that avian declines within energy fields may be influenced by increased susceptibility to nest predation and changes in food resource availability.\",\n",

Over the past decade, partners from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), State and Federal land management agencies, universities, and the public have collaborated to implement a long-term (defined here as more than 10 years), science-based program that assesses and enhances the quality and quantity of wildlife habitats in this region while facilitating responsible development. The USGS Science Team completes scientific research and develops tools that inform and support WLCI partner planning, decision making, and on-the-ground management actions. In fiscal year 2017, USGS published 18 products (including peer-reviewed journal articles, USGS series publications, and data releases), prepared an additional 7 products for publication, and presented 14 talks or posters at professional scientific meetings in addition to numerous informal presentations to WLCI partners at meetings and workshops. In this report, we summarize the science themes that describe USGS science for the WLCI and highlight work completed in fiscal year 2017 for each science theme. We also provide information on how USGS science is being used by land managers to better achieve habitat conservation objectives.',\n",

Many of the studies were undertaken in the 1970s during the last oil shale boom. One such study analyzed the chemistry, mineralogy, and stable isotopy of the Green River Formation in the three major depositional basins: Piceance basin, Colo.; Uinta basin, Utah; and the Green River basin, Wyo. One depositional-center core from each basin was sampled and analyzed for major, minor, and trace chemistry; mineral composition and sulfide-mineral morphology; sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon forms; and stable isotopic composition (delta34S, delta15N, delta13C, and delta18O). Many of these data were published and used to support interpretative papers (see references herein). Some bulk-chemical and carbonate-isotopic data were never published and may be useful to studies that are currently exploring topics such as future oil shale development and the climate, geography, and weathering in the Eocene Epoch. These unpublished data, together with most of the U.S. Geological Survey data already published on these samples, are tabulated in this report.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) hosted the second Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) Science and Management Workshop at the University of Wyoming Conference Center and Hilton Garden Inn on May 12, 13, and 14, 2009, in Laramie, Wyo. The workshop focused on six topics seen as relevant to ongoing WLCI science and management activities: mapping and modeling resources for decisionmaking; data information and management; fish and wildlife research; changing landscapes; monitoring; and reclamation and offsite mitigation. Panelists gave presentations on ongoing research in these six areas during plenary sessions followed by audience discussions. Three breakout groups focused on discussing wildlife, reclamation, and monitoring. Throughout the plenary sessions, audience discussions, and breakout groups, several needs were repeatedly emphasized by panelists and workshop participants: developing a conservation plan and identifying priority areas and species for conservation actions; gaining a deeper understanding of sagebrush ecology; identifying thresholds for wildlife that can be used to create an 'early warning system' for managers; continuing to collect basic data across the landscape; facilitating even greater communication and partnership across agencies and between scientists and land managers; and engaging proactively in understanding new changes on the landscape such as wind energy development and climate change. Detailed proceedings from the workshop are captured and summarized in this report.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With rapidly changing landscape conditions within Wyoming and the potential effects of landscape changes on sage-grouse habitat, land managers and conservation planners, among others, need procedures to assess the location and juxtaposition of important habitats, land-cover, and land-use patterns to balance wildlife requirements with multiple human land uses. Biologists frequently develop habitat-selection studies to identify prioritization efforts for species of conservation concern to increase understanding and help guide habitat-conservation efforts. Recently, the authors undertook a large-scale collaborative effort that developed habitat-selection models for Greater Sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) across large landscapes in Wyoming, USA and for multiple life-stages (nesting, late brood-rearing, and winter). We developed these habitat models using resource selection functions, based upon sage-grouse telemetry data collected for localized studies and within each life-stage. The models allowed us to characterize and spatially predict seasonal sage-grouse habitat use in Wyoming. Due to the quantity of models, the diversity of model predictors (in the form of geographic information system data) produced by analyses, and the variety of potential applications for these data, we present here a resource that complements our published modeling effort, which will further support land managers.\\n\\nWe deliver all products described herein as online geographic information system data for visualization and downloading. We outline the data properties for each model and their data inputs, describe the process of selecting appropriate data products for multifarious applications, describe all data products and software, provide newly derived model composites, and discuss how land managers may use the models to inform future sage-grouse studies and potentially refine conservation efforts. The models, software tools, and associated opportunities for novel applications of these products should provide a suite of additional, but not exclusive, tools for assessing Wyoming Greater Sage-grouse habitats, which land managers, conservationists, and scientists can apply to myriad applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sweetwater County is located in the southwestern part of Wyoming and is the largest county in the State. A study to quantify the availability and describe the chemical quality of surface-water and ground-water resources in Sweetwater County was conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Wyoming State Engineer’s Office. Most of the county has an arid climate. For this reason a large amount of the flow in perennial streams within the county is derived from outside the county. Likewise, much of the ground-water recharge to aquifers within the county is from flows into the county, and occurs slowly. Surface-water data were not collected as part of the study. Evaluations of streamflow and stream-water quality were limited to analyses of historical data and descriptions of previous investigations. Forty-six new ground-water-quality samples were collected as part of the study and the results from an additional 782 historical ground-water-quality samples were reviewed. Available hydrogeologic characteristics for various aquifers throughout the county also are described.\\n\\nFlow characteristics of streams in Sweetwater County vary substantially depending on regional and local basin characteristics and anthropogenic factors. Because precipitation amounts in the county are small, most streams in the county are ephemeral, flowing only as a result of regional or local rainfall or snowmelt runoff. Flows in perennial streams in the county generally are a result of snowmelt runoff in the mountainous headwater areas to the north, west, and south of the county. Flow characteristics of most perennial streams are altered substantially by diversions and regulation.\\nWater-quality characteristics of selected streams in and near Sweetwater County during water years 1974 through 1983 were variable. Concentrations of dissolved constituents, suspended sediment, and bacteria generally were smallest at sites on the Green River because of resistant geologic units, increased vegetative cover, large diluting streamflows, and large reservoirs. Concentrations of dissolved constituents, suspended sediment, and bacteria generally were largest at sites in the Big Sandy River and Bitter Creek Basins. Some nutrient concentrations and bacteria counts exceeded various State and Federal water-quality criteria. Historical and recent anthropogenic activities contributed to natural sources of many dissolved constituents and suspended sediment.\\n\\nBoth water-table and artesian conditions occur in aquifers within the county. Shallow ground water is available throughout the county, although much of it is only marginally suitable or is unsuitable for domestic and irrigation uses mainly because of high total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations. Suitable ground water for livestock use can be found in most areas of the county. Ground-water quality tends to deteriorate with increasing distance from recharge areas and with increasing depth below land surface. Ground water from depths of greater than a few thousand feet tends to have TDS concentrations that make it moderately saline to briny. In some areas even shallow ground water has moderately saline TDS concentrations. Specific constituents in parts of some aquifers in the county occur in relatively high concentrations when compared to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency drinking-water standards. Relatively high concentrations of sulfate, fluoride, boron, iron, and manganese were found in several aquifers. Many ground-water samples from the Battle Spring aquifer in the Great Divide Structural Basin had high radionuclide concentrations.\\n\\nThe estimated mean daily water use in Sweetwater County in 2000 was 170.73 million gallons per day. Irrigation was the largest single use of water in the county with an estimated mean use of more than 92 million gallons per day. Surface water irrigation accounted for nearly 90 percent of the total irrigation water used in 2000. Although ground water is used to a much lesser extent than surface water, in many areas of the county it is the only source of water available.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'For the past several years, USGS has taken a multi-faceted approach to investigating the condition and trends in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. This recent effort builds upon decades of work in semi-arid ecosystems providing a specific, applied focus on the cumulative impacts of expanding human activities across these landscapes. Here, we discuss several on-going projects contributing to these efforts: (1) mapping and monitoring the distribution and condition of shrub steppe communities with local detail at a regional scale, (2) assessing the relationships between specific, land-use features (for example, roads, transmission lines, industrial pads) and invasive plants, including their potential (environmentally defined) distribution across the region, and (3) monitoring the effects of habitat treatments on the ecosystem, including wildlife use and invasive plant abundance. This research is focused on the northern sagebrush steppe, primarily in Wyoming, but also extending into Montana, Colorado, Utah and Idaho. The study area includes a range of sagebrush types (including, Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata, Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis, Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana, Artemisia nova) and other semi-arid shrubland types (for example, Sarcobatus vermiculatus, Atriplex confertifolia, Atriplex gardneri), impacted by extensive interface between steppe ecosystems and industrial energy activities resulting in a revealing multiple-variable analysis. We use a combination of remote sensing (AWiFS (1 Any reference to platforms, data sources, equipment, software, patented or trade-marked methods is for information purposes only. It does not represent endorsement of the U.S.D.I., U.S.G.S. or the authors), Landsat and Quickbird platforms), Geographic Information System (GIS) design and data management, and field-based, replicated sampling to generate multiple scales of data representing the distribution of shrub communities for the habitat inventory. Invasive plant sampling focused on the interaction between human infrastructure and weedy plant distributions in southwestern Wyoming, while also capturing spatial variability associated with growing conditions and management across the region. In a separate but linked study, we also sampled native and invasive composition of recent and historic habitat treatments. Here, we summarize findings of this ongoing work, highlighting patterns and relationships between vegetation (native and invasive), land cover, landform, and land-use patterns in the sagebrush steppe.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sagebrush-steppe ecosystems in North America have experienced dramatic elimination and degradation since European settlement. As a result, sagebrush-steppe dependent species have experienced drastic range contractions and population declines. Coordinated ecosystem-wide research, integrated with monitoring and management activities, would improve the ability to maintain existing sagebrush habitats. However, current data only identify resource availability locally, with rigorous spatial tools and models that accurately model and map sagebrush habitats over large areas still unavailable. Here we report on an effort to produce a rigorous large-area sagebrush-habitat classification and inventory with statistically validated products and estimates of precision in the State of Wyoming. This research employs a combination of significant new tools, including (1) modeling sagebrush rangeland as a series of independent continuous field components that can be combined and customized by any user at multiple spatial scales; (2) collecting ground-measured plot data on 2.4-meter imagery in the same season the satellite imagery is acquired; (3) effective modeling of ground-measured data on 2.4-meter imagery to maximize subsequent extrapolation; (4) acquiring multiple seasons (spring, summer, and fall) of an additional two spatial scales of imagery (30 meter and 56 meter) for optimal large-area modeling; (5) using regression tree classification technology that optimizes data mining of multiple image dates, ratios, and bands with ancillary data to extrapolate ground training data to coarser resolution sensors; and (6) employing rigorous accuracy assessment of model predictions to enable users to understand the inherent uncertainties. First-phase results modeled eight rangeland components (four primary targets and four secondary targets) as continuous field predictions. The primary targets included percent bare ground, percent herbaceousness, percent shrub, and percent litter. The four secondary targets included percent sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), percent big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), percent Wyoming sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata wyomingensis), and sagebrush height (centimeters). Results were validated by an independent accuracy assessment with root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 6.38 percent for bare ground to 2.99 percent for sagebrush at the QuickBird scale and RMSE values ranging from 12.07 percent for bare ground to 6.34 percent for sagebrush at the full Landsat scale. Subsequent project phases are now in progress, with plans to deliver products that improve accuracies of existing components, model new components, complete models over larger areas, track changes over time (from 1988 to 2007), and ultimately model wildlife population trends against these changes. We believe these results offer significant improvement in sagebrush rangeland quantification at multiple scales and offer users products that have been rigorously validated.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The condition of the sagebrush ecosystem has been declining in the Western United States, and greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a sagebrush-obligate species, has experienced concurrent decreases in distribution and population numbers. This has prompted substantial research and management over the past two decades to improve the understanding of sage-grouse and its habitats and to address the observed decreases in distribution and population numbers. The amount of research and management has increased as the year 2015 approaches, which is when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is expected to make a final decision about whether or not to protect the species under the Endangered Species Act. In 2012, the Sage-Grouse Executive Oversight Committee (EOC) of the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA) requested that the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) lead the development of a Greater Sage-Grouse National Research Strategy (hereafter Research Strategy). This request was motivated by a practical need to systematically connect existing research and conservation plans with persisting or emerging information needs. Managers and researchers also wanted to reduce redundancy and help focus limited funds on the highest priority research and management issues. The USGS undertook the development of this Research Strategy, which addresses information and science relating to the greater sage-grouse and its habitat across portions of 11 Western States. This Research Strategy provides an outline of important research topics to ensure that science information gaps are identified and documented in a comprehensive manner. Further, by identifying priority topics and critical information needed for planning, research, and resource management, it provides a structure to help coordinate members of an expansive research and management community in their efforts to conduct priority research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The recent proliferation of oil and natural gas energy development in southwest Wyoming has stimulated the need to understand wildlife responses to this development. Central to many wildlife assessments is the use of geospatial methods that rely on digital representation of energy infrastructure. Surface disturbance of the well pad scars associated with oil and natural gas extraction has been an important but unavailable infrastructure layer. To provide a digital baseline of this surface disturbance, we extracted visible oil and gas well pad scars from 1-meter National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery (NAIP) acquired in 2009 for a 7.7 million-hectare region of southwest Wyoming. Scars include the pad area where wellheads, pumps, and storage facilities reside, and the surrounding area that was scraped and denuded of vegetation during the establishment of the pad. Scars containing tanks, compressors, and the storage of oil and gas related equipment, and produced-water ponds were also collected on occasion. Our extraction method was a two-step process starting with automated extraction followed by manual inspection and clean up. We used available well-point information to guide manual clean up and to derive estimates of year of origin and duration of activity on a pad scar. We also derived estimates of the proportion of non-vegetated area on a scar using a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index derived using 1-meter NAIP imagery. We extracted 16,973 pad scars of which 15,318 were oil and gas well pads. Digital representation of pad scars along with time-stamps of activity and estimates of non-vegetated area provides important baseline (circa 2009) data for assessments of wildlife responses, land-use trends, and disturbance-mediated pattern assessments.',\n",

Previous simulations using a SPAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) model for dissolved solids specific to water year 1991 conditions in the Upper Colorado River Basin predicted an annual dissolved-solids load of 25,000 tons for the Henrys Fork Basin upstream from Antelope Wash. On the basis of computed dissolved-solids load data from Henrys Fork near Manila, Utah, together with estimated annual dissolved-solids load from Antelope Wash and Peoples Canal, this prediction was adjusted to 37,200 tons. As determined by simulations with the Upper Colorado River Basin SPARROW model, approximately 56 percent (14,000 tons per year) of the dissolved-solids load at Henrys Fork upstream from Antelope Wash is associated with the 21,500 acres of irrigated agricultural lands in the upper Henrys Fork Basin.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Over the past two decades, populations of Shiras moose (Alces alces shirasi) in western Wyoming have declined. Recent work on the Jackson herd in northwest Wyoming suggests that the 1988 Yellowstone fires and regional drought contributed to a considerable decline in calf recruitment, which coincided with the recovery of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) and gray wolves (Canis lupus occidentalis) to the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). Predation is also presumed to have contributed to declines in calf recruitment, but the relative influence of these predators has yet to be evaluated. We analyzed a time series of vital rates to identify the spatial extent and intensity at which predator density, habitat condition, and interacting abiotic factors limit population growth. We focused on neonate survival because calves are most vulnerable at this time and because calf recruitment has been shown to be one of the most important vital rates influencing population dynamics in large herbivores. Variables affecting neonate survival were calculated at the home range scale from 100 individuals in the Jackson herd, and 90 individuals in an adjacent herd directly to the south, where moose are exposed to markedly lower predator density. The most influential variables for neonate survival were winter severity from the previous year, burn severity of summer home ranges, and grizzly bear density. Our spatial analysis of individual fitness in these two herds suggests that Shiras moose in the GYE have struggled to cope simultaneously with significant effects of sub-optimal habitat conditions, adverse weather, and predator density, highlighting the need to prioritize efforts to conserve Shiras moose.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Few studies have investigated the persistence of wildlife populations in response to disease. Furthermore, wildlife disease research often underscores pathogens that cause mass mortalities rather than chronic diseases that cause high morbidity and mortality over longer timespans. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), an invariably fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of deer (Odocoileus spp.), elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), and moose (Alces alces shirasi) provides a framework to study the long-term effects of an endemic disease with incubation periods >12 months on free-ranging cervid populations. We hypothesized that CWD greatly reduces survival and reproduction causing annual population declines. Specifically, we determined the effect of CWD on mule deer (O. hemionus) demography using a Leslie matrix model to calculate the finite rate of population growth (λ). We captured adult (≥ 1.5 years old) deer from 2010 – 2014 in southeastern Wyoming where CWD prevalence typically exceeded 20% annually. Deer were antemortem CWD tested using tonsil biopsies and monitored using radio-telemetry and global positioning system collars. We found that CWD decreased adult annual survival; however, fawn production was not significantly influenced by infection. We estimated λ = 0.81 suggesting an annual population decline of 19% under current conditions. However, when CWD was excluded from the model λ = 1 suggesting stable annual population growth rates in the absence of CWD. A study of sympatric white-tailed deer (O. virginianus) found similar results with an annual population reduction of 10%, but an increasing population growth rate (λ = 1.07) when CWD was omitted from their model. These findings suggest endemic CWD is a population-limiting disease of deer and chronic diseases with protracted incubation periods can cause significant population declines.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Raptor and corvid electrocutions are a continental conservation concern. Despite the scope of the problem, mitigation is typically implemented at the local scales of individual electric utilities. By not considering landscape-scale patterns, conservation strategies may fail to focus mitigation where efforts are needed most. To enable resource managers to consider electrocution risk at larger scales, we developed a regional model of distribution power pole (pole) density in a grid of 1 square kilometer (km2 ) cells throughout Wyoming and Colorado. To do so, we obtained data on pole locations from a sample of electric utilities covering 31% of Colorado and Wyoming to develop a predictive model using a Random Forest machine learning classification procedure based on anthropogenic and natural land-cover characteristics. We used out-of-sample validation to test the model and then predicted pole density across Wyoming and Colorado. Pole density was influenced by road lengths, number of oil and gas wells, slope, development, and land cover. Poles were densest in areas with high road lengths, high numbers of wells, and relatively flat terrain, and in areas developed for agriculture or human residences. When model predictions are viewed together with species-specific habitat maps, locations where high pole densities overlap high-quality habitat suggest areas where mitigating electrocution risk could be prioritized. Communication between resource managers and local utilities could then clarify whether poles in areas of concern were atrisk. As an example, we compared model predictions with Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) nesting habitat in northeastern Wyoming to identify candidate areas of high electrocution potential. If poles in these areas were not built or previously retrofitted to minimize electrocution risk, retrofitting measures focused there may offer substantial conservation impacts. Thus, the model provides a framework for systematic spatial prioritization in support of regional conservation planning.',\n",

Dispersal plays a vital role in population ecology and is a driving factor of realized range expansion of wildlife populations. The naturally recolonized mountain lion population in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming offers a long term dataset to evaluate the role of dispersal in relation to true range expansion and recolonization of an apex predator in North America. Our primary objective was to document dispersal movements in relation to range expansion of mountain lions captured within the Black Hills ecosystem of southwestern South Dakota and eastern Wyoming, with an updated focus on female dispersal within and beyond the ecosystem. We documented several (n = 8) long-distance dispersal movements (>250 km) of male mountain lions and hypothesize that males making long-distance movements were in search of available mates. Since initial publication of results, we have documented several (n = 3) long-distance female dispersal movements. In order to address the notions of recolonization into eastern North America, we quantified potential mountain lion habitat in the Midwest, and modeled two scenarios that could impact recolonization of mountain lions (annual harvest of cougars in western populations vs. no harvest) in a spatially-explicit population viability analysis (PVA). Under both scenarios, results suggested that female mountain lions are likely to recolonize large patches of habitat in the Midwest within the next 25 years. The dispersal movements documented by our study indicate that range expansion and habitat recolonization are occurring and further suggest proactive efforts to increase public knowledge of mountain lion ecology in areas where they are recolonizing previously occupied range.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Collisions between vehicles and large mammals pose a threat to human safety and to wildlife populations. In Wyoming, the majority of collisions involve deer, averaging about 5,000 deer mortalities and costing $44-52 million per year. Crossing structures (road under- or over-passes, coupled with fencing) are the most effective means of mitigating this problem. In an analysis of the patterns of wildlife-vehicle collisions across Wyoming, we found that collisions were strongly associated with agricultural land outside of major towns – areas where it may not be feasible to install fencing and crossing structures. In places such as this, there is a need for effective mitigations that allow animals to safely cross roads without completely isolating them from the roadway. Roadside “wildlife reflectors” are marketed to accomplish this – by reflecting the beams of oncoming vehicles and “warning” animals not to cross. However, the evidence supporting the effectiveness of these reflectors is equivocal. We conducted a study of the efficacy of Streiter-Lite reflectors in central WY. In our first experiment, reflectors were either exposed or covered with white canvas bags. In a follow-up experiment, reflectors were either exposed or covered with black canvas bags. We found that carcass densities were 32% lower when reflectors were exposed compared to black bags, but 33% lower when covered with white bags than when they were exposed. Using direct observations of deer road-crossing behavior, we also found that deer were most likely to engage in safer, more vigilant road crossing behavior in the white bags treatment. These surprising results suggest that the white canvas bags are not only more effective than the reflectors, but were more effective than any other currently-existing mitigation that does not require fencing the roadway. These results suggest a possible new method for reducing the problem of wildlife-vehicle collisions in Wyoming and around the world.',\n",

Rather than have an outside keynote speaker, or even a conference official, the committee took Paul Hansen’s suggestion to hear from the profession itself. For this project, fish and wildlife professionals were surveyed for their opinions and ideas concerning successes and failures over the past 100 years of fish and wildlife management, including the strategies that were responsible for those successes, the strategies that did not work, and the implications of those successful and unsuccessful strategies for the future of fish and wildlife management in the next 100 years in North America. To achieve this task as scientifically as possible, WMI, Paul Hansen and Rollin Sparrowe and the Steering Committee partnered with Responsive Management to conduct the survey of fish and wildlife professionals. The results provided substantial insight into the strengths and weaknesses within the fish and wildlife management profession. While some of the findings may have been expected, other results were illuminating and thought-provoking. Overall, the fish and wildlife management efforts that are considered by the professionals who implement them to be the most successful over the past 100 years are: dedicated funds (such as the Federal Aid in Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration funds and the Duck Stamp), species recovery and management, the Endangered Species Act (ESA), land conservation, and the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation.

       "  'abstract': 'Wild horse (Equus ferus caballus) management on western North American is an escalating concern for ecological integrity on these landscapes. Identifying potential diet overlap between horses, livestock, and wildlife will inform management decisions to optimize multiple interests. To understand dietary relationships, we conducted a quantitative synthesis of microhistological fecal studies for wild horse, beef cattle (Bos spp.), domestic sheep (Ovis aries), elk (Cervus elaphus), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) diet composition on western rangelands of North America. Our search yielded 60 studies from 14 states, 1 Canadian province, and 2 Mexican states with 392 unique species-season samples. We summarized plant species into graminoid, forb, and browse functional groups. For wild horses, seasonal diet composition means for graminoids (77 to 89%), forbs (4 to 15%), and browse (3 to 10%) did not vary seasonally for any plant group (P ≤ 0.05). Univariate analyses and the calculation of effect sizes corroborated our finding that graminoid composition explained the potential overlap of wild horses with cattle regardless of season, with sheep and elk in the spring, with sheep in the summer, and with elk in the fall and winter. Although data indicate wild horse diets are primarily composed of graminoids, several studies reported unusual regionally specific shifts in response to winter snow that limited graminoid accessibility, leading to higher browse composition. Season, plant composition, and herbivore assemblage may all influence dietary competition between wild horses and other large herbivores sharing western North American rangelands; however, the low and nonsignificant heterogeneity values at alpha 0.01 for cattle:horse effect size comparisons suggest that cattle and horses respond to regional and seasonal variation similarly—a result not observed for other herbivore:horse comparisons. Our meta-analysis provides a robust data set for evaluations of diet composition for wild horses, livestock and wildlife, whereas no empirical studies have assessed all species together.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation is a major risk to aquatic ecosystems of national parks and recreation areas in the western United States. Elevated Hg concentrations in walleye and catfish tissue samples obtained from in Bighorn Lake within the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation (BICA) resulted in fish consumption advisories in Wyoming and Montana. Management of this issue is complex because there are several potential point sources of Hg near BICA (geothermal and anthropogenic), as well as atmospheric sources. An additional concern is the input of selenium (Se) to Bighorn Lake and the associated antagonistic interaction of Se and Hg with respect to toxicity modifications in fish. High sedimentation rates in the upper part of Bighorn Lake will require remediation in the near future. Additional information on Hg cycling in the reservoir is needed to assess the potential effects of sediment remediation on Hg bioaccumulation in fish. An increased understanding of Se and Hg sources entering BICA from the major tributaries (Shoshone River and Bighorn River) and the biogeochemical cycling and transfer of Hg through the food web to top predators could identify sediment management strategies that also reduce metal concentrations in BICA fish. We have begun to characterize the sources and concentrations of Hg and Se entering BICA by collecting water and sediment samples from 7 sites during a synoptic sampling event. Near-surface sediment samples were analyzed for Se total, Hg total, MeHg, and ratios of selected Hg isotopes. Whole-water and filtered water samples from different depths were analyzed for Se, Hg, and MeHg. Water column and sediment samples were collected for microbial analysis at the 7 sites using sterile techniques. Geochemical and microbial results from this study will increase the understanding of Se and Hg sources and cycling in BICA.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Managers and ecologists are under increased pressure to quantify and understand how stressors, natural or anthropogenic, interact to affect environmental and ecological change. Oil and natural gas development has expanded at an unprecedented rate and our understanding of how stressors associated with these activities affect aquatic ecosystems is limited. Hydrology is also an important driver of chemical, physical, and biological processes in stream ecosystems. Oil and natural gas development and altered hydrology have been shown to individually affect stream biota; however less is known regarding how these stressors interact to affect ecological change. The objective of this study is to examine the potential interaction between oil and natural gas development and natural annual variation in hydrology on fish population dynamics. Specifically, we examined changes in the abundance of mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdii), mountain sucker (Catostomus platyrhynchus), and Colorado River cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki pleuriticus) at 60 sites in the Wyoming Range between 2012 and 2015. Overall, very few mottled sculpin and no cutthroat trout were collected from high development sites, though mountain suckers were present in good abundances. At sites with lower levels of development, all species exhibited similar oscillating patterns in abundance that could potentially be linked with the previous year’s stream discharge. Preliminary results suggest that mountain sucker abundance may shift through time in relation to interactions of development and hydrology. By understanding the interactions between anthropogenic and natural stressors, we can better inform managers and conservation biologists of best management practices that may be needed to reduce negative effects for chemical, physical, and biological processes in stream ecosystems.',\n",

Aquatic habitats are essentialfor Wyoming’s fish and wildlife communities. Oil and gas drilling practices and associated infrastructure can alter aquatic habitats through increased road densities and vehicle traffic, fragmentation of habitat, water use, and pollution of air, water, and soil. We examined habitat and water quality across stream sites in southwest Wyoming that are overlaid by the LaBargeOil and Gas Field. We found that stream reaches that were highly affected by oil and natural gas development had degraded habitat conditions, as indicated by reduced riparian cover,increased fine suspended sediment, and reduced water quality.

       "  'abstract': 'Gas fields now cover more than 2,300 mi2 of land in southwestern Wyoming. Gas fields fragment sagebrush habitats by converting native vegetation to roads, well pads, and utility corridors. Pygmy rabbits are a sagebrush-obligate species of greatest conservation need, but little information exists describing the relationship between gas fields and pygmy rabbits. We surveyed 120 plots on four major Wyoming gas fields (Creston/Atlantic Rim, Jonah, Moxa Arch, Pinedale Anticline Project Area) during 2011-2013, measured the amount of shrubsteppe vegetation and each disturbance element present (e.g., roads, well pads, buried utility corridors) within 1 km of each plot using ArcGIS and 2012 NAIP imagery, then modeled the relationship between gas field elements and pygmy rabbit presence and abundance. Well pads, adjacent disturbance, well pad spur roads, and buried utility corridors comprised the majority of the disturbance present (4% of total area on Creston/Atlantic Rim – 12% on Jonah). Rabbit presence was lower on the Jonah field (16% of plots) than the other three gas fields (52-76% of plots). Using logistic regression and accounting for variation among years and gas fields, the most parsimonious presence/absence model contained the variables buried utilities (negative association), a variable derived by pooling well pads, associated disturbance, and associated spur roads (negative association), and residual shrub cover (positive association). We then used boosted regression trees to analyze an index of abundance (number of active burrows) in plots where rabbits were present. Abundance varied among gas fields (mean = 5.4 burrows/plot at Creston/Atlantic Rim versus ~1.0 burrow/plot on the other gas fields), and that buried utilities, well pads, adjacent disturbance, and associated spur roads had a strong negative relationship with abundance in one or both modeled years. Conversion of shrubsteppe vegetation to gas field elements has a measurable effect on pygmy rabbit distribution and abundance.',\n",

Advances in drilling technologies such as directional and horizontal well bores, however, can help to minimize undesirable impacts while meeting future energyproduction demand. In this study, we used a unique energy-footprint simulator to model future build-out designs that varied in numbers of vertical, directional, and horizontal wells and determined potential impacts of designs to pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis) habitat. Using the footprint simulator, we spatially modeled future (30 years) wells, pads, and roads in oil and gas project areas in SW Wyoming based on proposed and pending development build-out designs. We simulated a series of alternative design scenarios that successively increased the number of directional and horizontal wells, where geologically feasible, for the same targeted level of energy production. Scenarios used the same number of proposed well numbers but reduced the number of well pads (multi-well pads, directional drilling), or reduced both the number of wells and well pads (horizontal drilling). We scored scenario impacts on pygmy rabbits using an empirically derived model that estimates habitat-occupancy probability given the amount of pad and road surface disturbance within 1 km of suitable habitat. Results illustrate the potential to reduce impacts to pygmy rabbits with increasing use of directional and horizontal drilling. On average, for every reduction of 100 pads there was a 170 ha decrease in total surface disturbance and a 100 ha increase in the amount of rabbit habitat with a probability of occupancy >0.5. Patch sizes of rabbit habitat with >0.5 probability of occupancy also increased with decreasing pad numbers. Overall, results illustrate the ecological benefits of employing directional and horizontal drilling technologies in future resource recovery.',\n",

Big game hunting opportunities may be closely tied to these effects, but empirical analyses of the impacts of oil and gas development on hunting are scarce. In this study, we examined spatial and temporal trends in hunting success and their relationships to oil and gas development density. We focused on hunting success within all hunt areas for three big game species in Wyoming from 2008 to 2014: Cervus canadensis (elk), Odocoileus hemionus (mule deer), and Antilocapra americana (pronghorn). Using 'harvest per hunter day' as a response, we compared linear mixed-effects models for each species that included either total well density (all wells constructed up to the year of record) or active well density (only those wells currently producing oil/gas in that year) as the key predictor variable. The models also accounted for the fixed effects of road density, the proportion of the area that is public land unrestricted to hunters, the proportion of the area that is forested, the year of observation, and the average game population density, as well as random variation among hunt areas nested within associated game herd units. The presence of oil and gas wells had a positive influence on hunting success for elk and mule deer, with no overall influence on pronghorn, though effects varied depending on the animal’s life stage and sex. Models that included active wells outperformed those that included the cumulative total. Changes in hunting success as a result of oil and gas development could have subsequent impacts on hunter satisfaction and game populations, issues relevant to both hunters and wildlife managers.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The WLCI songbird project has provided a rare opportunity to investigate the mechanisms underlying wildlife responses to energy development in a rigorous and spatially and temporally replicated manner. Extraction of energy resources is a still-growing form of human-induced rapid environmental change in Wyoming and globally, and effective understanding of wildlife effects and mitigation strategies rests not only on what effects are occurring, but also how and why. Responses of the three sagebrush-obligate passerine birds (Brewer’s sparrow, Spizella breweri; sagebrush sparrow, Artemisiospiza nevadensis; and sage thrasher, Oreoscoptes montanus) that nest in the WLCI area are particularly important because, similar to the greater sage-grouse, all three are species of concern in Wyoming and declining throughout much of their range. The first phase of the project (2008-2009) demonstrated decreased abundance of two of the three species with increased natural gas well density. Because abundance can be a misleading indicator of habitat quality, however, we also assessed nest survival, which decreased with well density and proximity to the nearest well pad for all species. The vast majority of nest losses were due to nest predation. In Phase II (2011-2012), we deployed infrared video camera systems at nests and learned that rodents (including deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus) were the most important nest predators, and that their relative activity increased with surrounding habitat loss due to natural gas development. Rodent activity, moreover, was inversely related to nest survival. Our current focus (2014) is to test alternative hypotheses for why natural gas development appears to augment local populations of rodent nest predators. In the aggregate, natural gas fields in western Wyoming appear to be functioning as ecological traps for sagebrush songbirds, as birds are settling equally across sites, yet are experiencing decreased reproductive fitness in areas with more surrounding energy development.',\n",

A population at Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge, maintained by the release of captive-bred individuals, is one of the only known extant populations. Habitat alteration and disease are thought to be two causes of the Wyoming toad’s decline. Open riparian areas have been shown to be important for young individuals, likely facilitating growth, and possibly limiting disease. In the absence of disturbance, however, these open areas quickly become overgrown. We raised recently metamorphosed Wyoming toads in enclosures in areas around Mortenson Lake where vegetation was treated with either prescribed fire or cattle grazing. Toads were measured (mass and length) every 4 to 6 days to determine growth rate and upon release from the enclosure to determine final size. We found that toads raised in areas treated with fire had greater length and mass than toads raised in untreated vegetation. Toads in vegetation treated with cattle grazing were lighter than toads in vegetation that was not grazed; length was not significantly different between grazed and ungrazed areas. These results indicate that fire could be used as habitat restoration in areas managed for Wyoming toads.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Invasive species threaten biodiversity worldwide and are considered the most significant conservation threat after habitat loss and fragmentation. Invasive plants can have direct and indirect effects on wildlife by dramatically simplifying plant community composition and structure. Small mammals are an integral component of many ecosystems, however, the effects of invasive plants on small mammals are poorly understood. This study addresses a critical information need by determining how small mammal occupancy, abundance, survival, and richness are altered by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), a common invasive plant in North America. In 2013 and 2014, we trapped small mammals on 16 sites across a gradient of cheatgrass cover in Thunder Basin National Grassland, WY. We tested the predictive ability of 3 focal species traits and found the effect of cheatgrass on the probability of occupancy varied with a species’ habitat association but not with diet preference or locomotion style. In our species- specific analysis, cheatgrass had a negative effect on pocket mice (Perognathus spp.) occupancy, primarily open habitat species. By contrast, occupancy for harvest mice (Reithrodontomys spp.), closed habitat species, was positively correlated with cheatgrass. There was no effect of cheatgrass on occupancy for the Ord’s kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii) or the 13-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus). Cheatgrass had a positive, neutral, and negative affect on deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) depending on the metric. Finally, there was no effect of cheatgrass on species richness; however, the occupancy results suggest that small mammal community composition may shift as cheatgrass cover increases. Species’ traits partly predicted small mammal responses to cheatgrass, suggesting that a focal traits framework will help managers prioritize species based on their vulnerability to a specific habitat alteration, such as invasive plants.',\n",

This decline has resulted in significant amounts of historical Greater Sage-Grouse habitat left unsuitable for the bird’s survival requirements and in need of restoration. The typical method of broadcast seeding has proven difficult in areas with already established vegetation, giving the need to implement new restoration techniques. This study attempts to develop an effective method for transplanting Wyoming big sagebrush seedlings propagated from locally adapted seed and soil that will maximize the amount of soil moisture available to them through snow catchment fencing, fabric mulch, and seedling planting density. 648 sagebrush seedlings were planted in the spring of 2014 onto a 2 year old burn site using a randomized complete block design. Preliminary results show that the use of polypropylene fabric mulch to eliminate interspecific competition and retain soil moisture significantly increases the growth and survival rate of transplanted seedlings. Management implications for this method include planting shrub islands on burn areas in order to reintroduce a seed source or planting into critical habitat areas where sagebrush has been lost or damaged.',\n",

Prior to 2011, it was dominated by conifers, including Douglas’ and subalpine fir, limber and lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce, and Rocky Mountain juniper. Although the last major wildfire (circa 1940) had evolved into healthy stands of lodgepole pine, most other conifers were inflicted with insects and disease, including mountain pine beetle, mistletoe, and white pine blister rust. The blister rust was particularly apparent in limber pine, affecting even small young trees. Aspen and riparian habitat were largely encroached with conifers, and eighty year old photos showed conifer expansion into upland shrublands, with shrub species primarily comprised of mountain big sagebrush, Wyoming three-tip sagebrush, and black sagebrush, with scattered areas supporting bitterbrush and chokecherry. A managed wildfire in October 2011 resulted in 1400 acres burned, and a wildfire in August 2012 burned an additional 8,600 acres. Photos and 30 transects were established, and browse quality evaluated. Studies were established to monitor vegetation response, to help determine when livestock grazing could occur, to meet Greater Sage-Grouse core area policy, and to incorporate findings into future fire treatments on Ferris Mountain. Initial fire response was dominated by early successional species, such as evergreen ceanothus, ground smoke, and wild hollyhock, and re-sprouting species that include snowberry, chokecherry, aspen, Wyoming three-tip sage, bluebells, bluebunch wheatgrass, and king-spike fescue. Species negatively impacted (in addition to conifers) were bitterbrush, black sagebrush, and Idaho fescue. Areas with higher potential for cheatgrass expansion (2,000 acres) were aerially treated with Imazapic in the fall of 2012 and 2014. Cheatgrass was reduced or nonexistent, while native perennial species grew and expanded, with a reduction of annual forb species. Evergreen ceanothus response post-fire had more than double the crude protein compared to other shrub species.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Over the past century our western rivers have seen many alterations that have impacted fish and wildlife, stream function, and riparian habitat. Irrigation has been one of the primary perturbations to our stream systems with the construction of instream diversions to deliver water for both agricultural and municipal purposes. In many instances, instream diversions block natural movement of fish, cause entrainment in irrigation canals, and can disrupt channel morphology that leads to stream degradation. In addition, thousands of road crossings exist that impact natural fish movements and healthy stream function as well. To address these issues, Wyoming Game and Fish (WGF) officially began a fish passage program in 2009. Much of the work to date has focused on inventory of irrigation diversions and road crossings, prioritizing watersheds for work, developing partnerships with organizations such as Trout Unlimited, and delving into various projects to improve passage and reduce entrainment. Efforts are underway to increase the reach of this program through the Wyoming Water Strategy that was released by the Governor’s office in January 2015. Fish passage was 1 of 10 initiatives identified in that strategy to improve Wyoming’s water resources for the future. A great deal of passage work has already occurred in the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) boundary where efforts have focused on native species such as Colorado and Bonneville cutthroat trout, bluehead sucker, flannelmouth sucker, and roundtail chub. Projects have included removal and construction of barriers, installation of fish screens, and changes in water use through multiple partnerships. Reconnecting streams is vital for the future health of our fisheries and watersheds that will improve the resiliency of these systems in light of more frequent weather extremes. Without such work, we risk the loss of native species and further degradation of our water resources.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Encampment River flows north from the Continental Divide in Colorado into the Sierra Madre Range in southeastern Wyoming. As the river exits the mountains, it flows through a wide valley dominated by irrigated hay meadows and cottonwood galleries. Within this lower segment, the Encampment River is characterized by unstable reaches with accelerated bank erosion, channel degradation, and aggradation, and poor connections with floodplain habitats. The legacy effects of tie drives, mining, channel dredging, and land use have led to the present-day channel and riparian habitat conditions. Today, the effects of beetle kill in forested headwaters, climatic extremes, and altered stream flows exacerbate channel instability. In addition, concrete and cobble push-up dam diversions limit seasonal wild trout movements in the lower watershed. Over the last 5 years, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, Trout Unlimited, and Saratoga-Encampment-Rawlins Conservation District have partnered with the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative and many other partners to lead concentrated efforts for reconnecting and restoring stream habitat, riparian corridors, and fish passage throughout the lower watershed. To date, the partnership has restored over one mile of river and riparian corridor and replaced two cobble push-up dams with fish-friendly diversion structures. Over the next five years, the partners aim to restore two additional river miles, replace two cobble push-up dams, and create fish passage at a concrete diversion dam. These efforts will reconnect habitats for wild trout, and further strengthen relationships with local businesses, water users, landowners, and anglers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As with any type of project, monitoring is critical to track progress, evaluate success, identify problems, and make informed decisions for future management. Additionally, for projects to be successfully managed, a clear definition of success is necessary. On BLM lands in Wyoming, all oil and gas well pads undergoing reclamation are compared to an undisturbed reference site, which is often defined by a single 100 m transect. In a heterogeneous landscape, a single 100 m reference transect fails to capture variability or depict an adequate representation of a reference area. Likewise, a single transect on a site under reclamation may fail give an accurate representation of the reclamation site as a whole. In most cases, field technicians sample restoration sites and reference areas by selecting locations they believe to be most representative of an area, which should be avoided because it is subject to observer bias. Since sampling is representative and monitoring techniques vary between years, analyzing vegetative trends is difficult because reference sites are used as measuring sticks for success our ability to define success and set restoration targets is limited by inconsistencies in monitoring and may vary greatly from year to year. In order to evaluate vegetative trends, site stability and self- sustainability, long-term monitoring plans should be incorporated into overall reclamation plans. A sound monitoring plan must be unbiased, statistically reliable, repeatable, and economical. Due to the increasing demand for vegetation monitoring, sampling techniques should strive to become more cost- efficient and information-rich than in the past. While there are pros and cons to different vegetation sampling techniques, many studies have shown significant differences in results when multiple methods are used. Therefore, a long-term monitoring plan should incorporate standard techniques and permanent sampling areas to identify trends and evaluate habitat quality, site stability, resiliency, and self-sustainability. This talk will discuss strengths and weaknesses associated with different monitoring methodologies and make suggestions on improvement.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Environmental DNA (eDNA), shed DNA in the environment, is an emerging technique that can be leveraged to monitor biodiversity to meet wildlife management goals. Aquatic eDNA is particularly useful for monitoring amphibian, fish and invertebrate organisms. As a technique, eDNA is extremely reliable, detects presence for less than 3 weeks under tested conditions, and had higher detection rates than visual surveys. To introduce eDNA to wildlife managers and researchers, we will present a background on how eDNA works, protocols for eDNA collection, and relative costs. We will present a set of case studies using visual DNA: development of eDNA quantitative PCR, amphibian detection in plains systems, amphibian detection in forested systems, relating fish presence with amphibian presence (both using eDNA methods) and potential for eDNA for water quality monitoring. We are able to detect amphibians with high probability of detection, particularly when there was evidence of breeding. In addition, we find that chorus frogs are less likely to occur with the presence of fish. In addition, identification of macroinvertebrates for water quality monitoring is promising. We find the eDNA methods are highly reliable for most situations, but certainly not a substitution for visual surveys. We discuss under what conditions eDNA surveys may be most useful to meet research and management goals.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Traditional mapping is based on observation of existing vegetation – either current, what was there in the past (historical) or what is expected there based on understanding of the system based on previous experience (historical). Given current analysis capacity, we wanted to combine observation of existing vegetation with spatial statistical modeling in an attempt to develop a probabilistic map that could be improved through iterations with ground-truth sampling. Our objective was to develop a full-coverage map of the probability of occurrence of mountain shrub communities in the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative area. Potential mountain shrub predictor layers included topographic and remotely sensed variables. Topographic features were elevation, slope, eastness, and solar radiation index. The remotely sensed variable was the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre - France) imagery from 19 June 2007 and 4 August 2012. Models were tested using field observations. Three of four models tested had reasonable results: generalized linear models (GLM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and random forest (RF). Slope was the dominant predictive variable with NDVI in second in all models. Vegetation communities that occur in small, isolated patches or are structurally similar to different communities around them, such as mountain shrub communities in southwest Wyoming, are difficult to map using traditional methods. This work demonstrates an alternative approach to vegetation mapping that could be applied in other areas with similar situations.',\n",

Here, through three case studies involving riparian habitat monitoring, we describe the application of stereo imagery to create SfM terrain surfaces from digital images acquired using handheld cameras. Using these terrain models, we were able to measure surface roughness due to hummocks, soil volume loss from headcuts, and elevation profiles that illustrate channel incision and floodplain connectivity.

       "  'abstract': 'Rapid climate change affects nearly all biomes, causing notable shifts in phenology, community ecology and extinction dynamics. Favorable microclimates may buffer organisms against rapid change, thereby allowing time for populations to adapt. The degree to which microclimates facilitate the persistence of climate-sensitive species, however, is largely an open question. We addressed whether the importance of favorable microclimates was context-dependent in mammalian thermal specialists, using the American pika (Ochotona princeps) as a model organism. We tested four hypotheses about the relationship between microclimates and pika occurrence: 1) Local habitat hypothesis; 2) Subsurface microrefugia hypothesis; 3) Surface temperature hypothesis; and 4) Context-dependent hypothesis. We examined pika occurrence at 146 sites arranged along a gradient of elevation. Site characteristics such as slope, aspect, and forage availability were measured at each site. We deployed 40 pairs of temperature loggers at a subset of points to quantify how much the subterranean environment moderated surface temperatures. Relative support for competing hypotheses was quantified using logistic-regression models in an AICc framework. We found unequivocal support for the subsurface microrefugia hypothesis. Pikas were more likely to occur at sites where the subsurface environment substantially moderated surface temperatures. Microrefugium (surface temperature – subsurface temperature) was the single strongest predictor of pika occurrence, independent of other biotic characteristics. By buffering ambient temperatures, microrefugia likely influence where temperature-limited animals can persist in rapidly warming environments. As climate change continues to manifest, efforts to understand the changing dynamics of animal-habitat relationships will be enhanced by considering both the availability and quality of microrefugia.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The success of many management efforts rest on understanding how energy availability affects population performance. Because population-level energy limitations signal that a population is near its carrying capacity, methods for estimating energy-performance relationships are needed. To meet this need, endocrinology has recently emerged as a popular tool for estimating energyperformance relationships. Endocrine markers such as glucocorticoids (GC) and triiodothryonine (T3) reflect both energy reserves and energy intake in small-bodied animals and in animals within controlled laboratory conditions. It is unclear, however, whether these endocrine markers translate to energy reserves and energy intake for large, free-ranging animals that possess greater fasting endurance and the ability to adjust their foraging behavior in response to energy deficits. We investigated relationships among endocrine markers and metrics of energy reserves and energy intake in free-ranging moose (Alces alces). T3 increased as energy reserves declined, a pattern opposite to predictions derived from animals in controlled laboratory conditions. GC was poorly associated with energy reserves, but increased predictably with increased energy intake, thus supporting a previously posited anti-stress hypothesis. The directionality of these relationships indicate moose forage in a state-dependent manner, where individuals with few reserves have greater energy intake than individuals with ample reserves. It is often assumed that GC and T3- energy relationships developed in the lab translate well to free-ranging populations, but our results indicate that we need to rethink how we apply endocrine tools in the management of big game herds.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Drought-induced forest mortality has been reported in western North America over the last decade. Of particular concern is decline in aspen forest, which provides important habitat for many wildlife species and domestic livestock. Understanding patterns of mortality and forest response to severe drought is important to resource managers, given the frequency of these events are expected to increase in the future. Vegetation indices derived from remotely sensed data can be used to analyze forest condition over large areas and over long time periods. We analyzed a 22-year (1985-2012) time series of satellite data to determine changes in forest that experienced a relatively dry period since 2000, punctuated by two years of extreme drought. We modelled the relationship between satellite-derived productivity and field data; then applied the model to the long-term data series to uncover the location, direction, and timing of change. The Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) had the strongest correlation with plant area index (R2 = 0.64) and canopy gap fraction (R2 = 0.65). Trends were not consistent with respect to forest type or topography, as northern aspects were most likely to exhibit a negative trend. During the study period, over twice as much aspen forest (16.5%) experienced a significant (p < 0.05) negative trend, compared to a positive trend (7.1%). Field plots with a negative trend had a lower live density, and higher amounts of standing dead and down trees compared to plots with no trend. Our analysis identifies spatially explicit patterns of long-term trends anchored with ground-based evidence to highlight areas of forest that are resistant, persistent, or vulnerable to severe drought. The results provide a long-term perspective on forest condition in this area and can be used to inform management actions and monitoring at local scales.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The upper Green River Basin in southwestern Wyoming provides important habitat for a variety of aquatic and terrestrial species, as well as supporting multiple land uses including energy extraction, agriculture, and tourism. Groundwater and surface-water resources of this semi-arid basin are critical to both wildlife and human activities. Understanding the interaction between streams and nearby groundwater in unconsolidated, shallow aquifers is an important component for describing stream dynamics. In particular, groundwater contribution to streamflow can moderate stream temperature during the summer and provide a source of water during winter in the form of base flow. The USGS is using new methods for determining groundwater and surface-water interaction by installing shallow wells on both stream banks at two existing, long-term streamgages in the upper Green River Basin. These sites, located on the New Fork River near Big Piney, Wyoming, and on the Green River near LaBarge, Wyoming, are being utilized to understand the dynamics of the groundwater and surface‐water system in that part of the Basin. Water elevation and temperature data from both the wells and streams are being used to determine when the stream may be losing water to or gaining water from groundwater. These data will be input into a two-dimensional model to estimate the volume of water loss or gain to the stream at that location. Additionally, geohydrologic analysis of the northern Green River structural basin shows groundwater in select bedrock units that underlie the shallow aquifers in some areas are under pressure. Water from wells completed this bedrock can often flow without a pump, and a flowing (artesian) well was drilled near the New Fork River streamgage during August, 2015. Data from the flowing well will be used to describe potential groundwater flow from the deeper, pressurized bedrock into the shallow aquifers and subsequently into area streams.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Bighorn Basin located in north central Wyoming has some of the largest deposits of quality bentonite throughout the world. Historically, reclamation efforts to establish plant communities similar to premine sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) grassland plant communities have been limited due to the absence of shrub regulatory standards and poor response of sagebrush to reclamation efforts on bentonite mine lands. The lack of suitable shrub cover is believed to have a negative effect on sagebrush obligate species, such as the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). The objective of this study is to determine if sagebrush communities are reestablishing on reclaimed bentonite mined lands under conventional reclamation techniques. Our data indicate that sagebrush establishment on reclaimed bentonite lands in the Big Horn Basin has not been successful using conventional methods. Five study sites were reclaimed in the past 15 years, while six were reclaimed more than 15 years ago. The younger sites have a mean sagebrush density of 900 stems hectare¯1 while the older sites have a mean of 5140 stems hectare¯1. Native reference sites have a mean sagebrush density of 10,763 stems hectare¯1. Even the densities of the older reclaimed sites are only about half of observed sagebrush densities on native reference sites. These results are interpreted as indicating that conventional methods of sagebrush reestablishment used in bentonite mineland reclamation are ineffective in the short term, 15 years or less. That is, initial seeding efforts during site reclamation result in very little sagebrush establishment. However, over the long term, natural seed dispersal of native sagebrush from undisturbed areas surrounding reclaimed mine sites appears to have resulted in reestablishment of greater densities of sagebrush plants. It is also believed that other newly developed reclamation technologies may be effective in reestablishing formidable sagebrush communities on reclaimed bentonite mined lands.',\n",

Reclamation efforts across sagebrush steppe in Wyoming have been successful in reestablishing herbaceous biomass (often exceeding that of undisturbed sites), but restoration of the dominant sagebrush component (Artemisia tridentata) has proven difficult. The sagebrush steppe vegetation community possesses patchiness and heterogeneity. These shrub-associated spatial patterns are apparent belowground in abiotic and biotic soil properties and influence distribution of water and nutrient cycling. We hypothesize that drastic disturbance (vegetation removal and topsoil handling) alters the degree of variability and spatial structure of both aboveground and belowground communities. Specifically, we predict that disturbed and reclaimed areas experience homogenization in above- and belowground properties. We established plots on a chronosequence of reclaimed pipelines and adjacent undisturbed reference areas in south central Wyoming. Vegetation and soils (0-5 cm) were sampled and analyzed for physical, chemical, and biological properties. Results suggested that recently reclaimed areas had more vegetative biomass, and more homogeneous and continuous vegetative cover. Conversely, undisturbed plots displayed a more patchy distribution of a more diverse plant community. Reclaimed plots of all ages also demonstrated less variability in soil characteristics, and these belowground patterns appeared to be associated with the vegetation. These findings emphasize the potential importance of reestablishing the sagebrush component on disturbed lands for successfully restoring ecosystem structure and function',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In 2006 a pilot project was developed to relocate Wyoming Big sage (Artemisia tridentate ssp. Wyomingensis) to areas disturbed by the oil and gas industry, their contractor, and the BLM. This project proved to have more benefits than just the salvage of mature sage brush, in that it was able to create micro habitats for other vital native plants and organisms that the Greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) rely upon for survival. Methods used for the projects identified reclamation locations free of undesirable plants, within Greater sage grouse habitat, and a dense sage brush area that was associated with grasses and forbs no more than 75 meters from the relocation site. The project location had disturbance of +/- 7.5 acres, with a total maximum project area of +/- 16.2 acres. 1000 shrubs were relocated on the first project site while only removing one shrub for every 66 square meters. This location had a 90% survivorship in the first year, there were four other locations planted at the same density as the offsite (865 total plants) resulting in 45% survival with those that did not survive having 99% survival of the grasses and forbs that were translocated with the shrubs. Shrubs that did not survive caught snow and held much needed moisture supporting grasses and forbs that were moved with the shrub leading to a more diverse and healthy stand of native plants, that supply needed rescores for brood rearing for the Greater sage grouse as well as a jump on the habitat to be restored to its natural ecological sire characteristics. This application can aid in the enhancement of habitat for the Greater sage grouse within critical core areas not only in oil and gas development but as a practical landscape application.',\n",

In October 2005, 72 entries of 50 native species were drill-seeded on a shut-in well-pad site, in single species plots in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Also, two seed mixtures were broadcast and drill-seeded, and one seed mixture was hydro-seeded on disturbed areas adjacent to the monoculture plots.

Observed phenotypic attributes of a given accession or releases are sometimes deemed less important than origin of source. The complexities involved in native plant material development require the right match of product growth and expansion to fit customer needs.

This culvert was perched, created a barrier that was impassable for native fishes and the stream channel was extremely incised. The BLM had already installed a bridge upstream from the culvert so it was no longer needed. However, simply removing the culvert would have allowed a head-cut to continue upstream causing further channel incision and mobilizing large quantities of sediment. The old channel was filled in and the new channel was built back on top of its original flood plain. The completed project has approximately 2,500 feet of reconstructed channel. The project has increased the riparian area, provided fish passage and enhanced the fish and wildlife habitat. In the spring of 2011, Muddy Creek experienced extremely high flows for an extended amount of time. The project was completed in November of 2010 and no growing season was given to the riparian areas going into winter.

       "  'abstract': 'Lower treeline limber pine woodlands are ecologically distinct ecotonal systems which have received little attention in scientific research. Their position on the lower treeline and foothills in semi-arid climate systems is predicted to be particularly vulnerable to climate change. These limber pine woodlands are often thought to be “invading” more desirable vegetation types, so eradication has been an accepted practice to limit “encroachment”. The lack of economic value fosters the perception that these lower treeline woodlands are “weeds” which need to be controlled and maintained only on steep rocky slopes that will not support other vegetative types. Their expansion into grass and shrublands is thought to be solely from management actions such as wildland fire suppression and livestock grazing. This view does not account for the dynamic relationships between climate, vegetation, and disturbance that the ecotones between different biomes respond to. Current base line vegetation models are based on vegetative communities that developed under different climatic conditions than are forecasted for the future. Current climate models for these areas predict an increase in temperature of between 1° to 7° F. Changes in precipitation are also predicted, with a summer precipitation decrease from 10 to 50 percent and winter precipitation increase from 10 to 25 percent. The concept of Stationarity, that natural systems fluctuate within an unchanging envelope of variability, has been the foundation for the practice of natural resource management. Because of the rapidly changing climate conditions, this envelope no longer exists. Not enough is known about the lower treeline limber pine and the biotic communities dependent upon them to assume traditional management activities. A series of carefully delineated basic and applied research questions needs to be formulated and answered to provide a fuller understanding of the ecological role(s) of lower treeline woodlands and to change the current management paradigms.',\n",

Joining efforts with State Wildlife Agencies, the Act funded wildlife research, species reintroduction, habitat acquisition, management and restoration, and hunter education and safety programs. It wasn’t again until the mid-1980s with the implementation of the North American Waterfowl Conservation Act, 1985 Food Security Act (Farm Bill) Conservation Provisions and establishment of the US Fish and Wildlife Service Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program that unprecedented opportunities were created for habitat restoration on private lands.

In addition to reducing wild life vehicle collisions and maintaining migration corridor connectivity, use of underpasses by wildlife may provide valuable information for wildlife managers. We used a newly constructed underpass and associated trail cameras to collect data for mule deer in relation to timing of migration, classification of animals by sex and age class, and fawn survival over winter. From October 2009 to December 2010, we documented 12,130 deer using the underpass. We used a negative binomial analysis to test three hypotheses of factors affecting mule deer use of the underpass during fall migration of 2010 (n = 5,354): temperature, precipitation, and both temperature and precipitation. We found that deer use of the underpass was negatively associated with minimum daily air temperature and positively associated with snow depth. We compared underpass classification data with aerial classification data and found that aerial counts resulted in fewer fawns and adult bucks compared to the underpass data. Underpasses may increase the probability of detecting small-bodied (fawns) or solitary (bucks) individuals, and thus improve estimates of fawn and mature buck-to-doe ratios. By comparing the number of fawns per 100 adult deer between fall and spring migration we may be able to determine fawn survival over winter. Wildlife managers that have access to wildlife underpasses should consider their use for collection of important data for management and harvest regulations.',\n",

Our team (comprised of scientists and rangeland specialists at the University of Wyoming, The Nature Conservancy, and Sublette County Conservation District) is scoping the potential for a PES program in the Green River Basin. The ecosystem services considered are maintenance or improvement of downstream water resources and maintenance or improvement of wildlife habitat and riparian condition. Examples of practices under consideration include altered grazing patterns and choice of irrigation practices and timing. Some practices provide multiple ecosystem services that could then be bundled for multiple buyers. The basin is one of the key headwaters of the Colorado River and home to one of the nation’s largest natural gas fields. A PES mechanism appeals to members of the community, who are looking for ways to maintain traditional land uses in spite of development pressures within the basin. This PES project will adopt the techniques of verification and accounting tested in other PES programs but involve the community in determining watershed and habitat improvement approaches that best fit local conditions. We are currently working with interested landowners and potential funders (for example energy companies) to determine ecosystem services and contract terms that would be amenable to buyers and sellers alike. We are using existing conservation plans that include ecological sites to determine which ecosystem services and locations in the basin would be optimal.

Of particular concern is the convergence of development and sage-grouse populations in Wyoming. Bold actions have been taken by federal agencies, states and land trusts to conserve sage-grouse through conservation easements and policy changes that limit development. We developed build-out scenarios to simulate future energy and residential development to measure the efficacy of conservation actions at protecting sage-grouse populations. Our analysis addressed the following questions: (1) How much sage-grouse population loss is averted by conservation easements and/or a sage-grouse core area policy? and (2) What is the return-on-investment for sage-grouse populations associated with these conservation actions? We found that Wyoming sage-grouse populations can be expected to decline by 11-18% even with the core area policy in place. Conservation easements have the potential to further abate this loss, with each $100 million of easements reducing expected declines by 3% if targeted in core areas, but up to 10% if targeted to the largest populations with the greatest threats. Our results provide unbiased estimates of the impacts of future fragmentation on sage-grouse and the potential contribution of the Wyoming’s core area policy and private conservation easements at varying levels of funding. These estimates can guide the quantity and placement of future conservation work, so that federal and state agencies can work together with land trusts to support enough conservation in the right places to maintain a large and functioning sage-grouse population.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Collaborative public involvement in the preparation of National Forest land management plans is a regulatory mandate (36 CFR 219). Typical “scoping” activities in that public involvement have not been GIS-based, instead comments received are assumed to apply to the entire forest or to a part of the forest through a verbal description. In addition, there has been little if any opportunity for individuals to see or react to the comments of others until they are compiled at the end of the commenting period. Thus, comments are in effect geographically imprecise as well as isolated from collaborative learning opportunities. The US Forest Service, in cooperation with the US Geological Survey, is presently developing a “collaborative mapping” web-based tool to improve both of the above limitations. A typical web-site user will be able to attach written comments to either a single point, line, or a polygon. In addition, they may attach a photograph or link to a document. Another user has the opportunity to add to that comment and create a conversation—visible to all and open to further commenting. National forest staff will also have the ability to enter into those “conversations.” The outcome is that the exchange of information, and learning, can occur much earlier in the planning process and with greater transparency. There is no limit to the number of public comments, or responses to those comments, that can be entered. National forest staff will be able to query and sort comments on key words, text strings, and dates. Thus, they are quickly able to also see where certain types of comments (if any) seem to be occurring. Designed primarily for enhancing collaboration with the public the tool may serve effectively as an “internal” collaboration tool for interdisciplinary teams (IDTs) or project teams for better communication among team members.',\n",

These include such benefits as recreational opportunities, commercial uses, ecosystem services, and subsistence. Management actions on these lands can affect various private and public stakeholders who often have diverse values and preferences about the use and management of public resources. Therefore, these social and economic impacts of planning and management need to be adequately and systematically addressed, particularly in controversial situations where diverse stakeholders are highly engaged and may contest management decisions. USGS scientists have worked with the BLM, NPS, and USFS to develop a web-based decision tool for Assessing Socioeconomic Planning Needs (ASPN) which enables natural resource managers and planners to develop custom socioeconomic assessment plans tailored to their individual land units and specific planning needs. ASPN allows planners and managers to establish the broad social and economic themes they may want to address, identify sub-issues to assess under those broad themes; and determine the intensity of the issues. ASPN then suggests analysis methods for addressing the identified issues using various inputs including time and budget needs. This tool will improve the planning process by: 1) systematically covering the breadth of issues facing land and resource management agencies; 2) identifying and prioritizing the planning issues that will require a social and/or economic analysis in the management plan; 3) providing a range of recommended social and economic methods which could be used to address the identified planning issues 4) realistically accounting for budget and time constraints; 5) including consideration of appropriate regulations regarding environmental policy; and 6) providing justification and documentation of the chosen analysis and tools.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The development of oil and gas in Southwest Wyoming has help open doors for the invasion of non-native plants into the ecosystem. The high desert sagebrush communities found in Southwest Wyoming have a variety of sensitive soils that when disturbed are targeted by undesirable plants such as Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). In 2008 within the Jonah oil and gas field a half mile of reclaimed pipeline was identified to have great densities of cheatgrass ranging from 61% cover to > 68% cover. This resulted in a treatment plan that included three treatment plots that were +/- half acre in size and a written integrated management plan using both chemicals and mechanical/ cultural methods were developed that has proven to have reduced the infestation to a post treatment of < 1% cover from > 63% pretreatment. The initial treatment of 2 oz. per acre Imazipic and hand pulling of the cheatgrass has resulted in control of the cheatgrass for the past four growing seasons, with no damage to the native plants that has been noted. These first plots have made way for research to approve another chemical Rimsulfuron, for use on cheatgrass by the BLM in the near future. To date over 300 acres of cheatgrass infested upland have been treated to result in the reduction of the infestations of > 37% in the first year. Oil and gas companies are utilizing integrated management plans for cheatgrass based these results in several fields within the Pinedale area, in addition using this same approach to control cheatgrass in many areas within the Kemmerer field office. In Pinedale a Cheatgrass task group has been formed, and is moving forward on treatments in coordination with the local sage grouse working group, Wyoming Game and Fish and the Sublette County Weed and Pest District, BLM and WLCI.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Annual Bromus species are perhaps the most ubiquitous and problematic weedy species of western rangelands. Some land managers and scientists have historically minimized potential impacts of annual bromes in our region, but brome populations are exhibiting an increasing trend in Wyoming and Colorado. The rate of expansion is predicted to increase relative to climate change models. Current perceptions of downy brome impacts on forage availability and efficacy of control methods vary widely among natural resource professionals and land managers throughout the state. Although its prevalence is increasing, the current distribution may present opportunities to prevent crossing an ecological threshold in many areas because an increase in fire frequency has not yet occurred. In heavily-infested areas, chemical control alone may be insufficient to convert annual-dominated rangelands to perennial-dominated grasslands with higher forage value. Challenges to developing a successful management program for such a widespread invasive as downy brome may be exacerbated where multiple ecological regions converge and ecological responses to control tactics differ across the management landscape. An additional challenge in both the western Great Plains and Wyoming Basin is the widespread surface disturbance related to the resource extraction industry. Such challenges may only be successfully addressed by implementing an integrated strategy including proactive prioritization of investment into protecting areas with high-quality habitat from future impacts, aggressively managing bromes in areas with high recovery potential and approaching thresholds, and managing grazing to favor desirable perennial species. Regional cooperative groups involving ranchers, agency personnel, researchers, and others may lead to productive landscape-scale programs.',\n",

We have had a surveying crew for seven years whose primary focus is to survey areas where spray crews do not go. This is the main part of our Early Detection program. For the past three years we have had a Rapid Response crew. Using our gathered data we set parameters to determine which infestations will be considered high priority treatment. The Rapid response crew is responsible for the bulk of these treatments. This is considered the Early Detection and Rapid Response (EDRR) part of our management plan, equal in importance to other established programs. Each county in the state of Wyoming has a Weed and Pest District funded by a one mill property tax. Some counties with leafy spurge or other special management weed targets can take up to 2 mills. So funding, and therefore programs, varies from county to county. Recording weed locations is something that every county now does. Similar to the fact that each county has their own weed management program; each county has their own methods and philosophy about recording infestations. Every county would like to have as much information about the location of weed infestations as possible. So in addition to their own programs, they are also looking to gather information from outside sources. “The big picture” on weed distribution is now being utilized by Districts and becoming a vital part of their weed management strategies.',\n",

Regional curves relate bankfull-channel geometry and bankfull discharge to drainage area in regions with similar runoff characteristics and are used to estimate the bankfull discharge and bankfull-channel geometry when the drainage area of a stream is known. One-variable, ordinary least-squares regressions relating bankfull discharge, cross-sectional area, bankfull width, and bankfull mean depth to drainage area were developed from data collected at 39 streamgages in or near Wyoming. Watersheds draining to these streamgages are within the Rocky Mountains Hydrologic Region of Wyoming and neighboring states. Two sets of regional curves were developed; one for streamgages representing the range of mean annual precipitation and one for streamgages with greater than 25 inches mean annual precipitation. Drainage area explains most of the variability in cross-sectional area for all streamgages and for streamgages with greater than 25 inches mean annual precipitation (R2 = 0.83, and 0.91 respectively). For all streamgages and streamgages with greater than 25 inches mean annual precipitation, drainage area explains less of the variability in bankfull discharge (R2 = 0.74 and 0.87, respectively), bankfull width (R2 = 0.81 and 0.83, respectively) and bankfull mean depth (R2 = 0.44 and 0.64, respectively).

The WGQMN samples wells to establish baseline groundwater quality in priority areas where groundwater has been identified as an important source of public or private water supplies, is susceptible to contamination, and is overlain by one or multiple land-use activities that could negatively impact groundwater resources. The WGQMN project area consists of 33 priority areas identified by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality's Aquifer Prioritization for Ambient Ground Water Monitoring Project in the 7 principal river basins of the state. Groundwater samples are collected from existing shallow wells (500 feet or less). Wells are stratified by depth and aquifer type. Upon further evaluation of data, a subset of wells are selected to include in the WGQMN. All groundwater samples are analyzed for a number of standard analytes (major ions, trace elements, nutrients, volatile organic compounds, total dissolved solids, dissolved organic carbon, H-2/H-1 and O-18/O-16 isotope ratios, bacteria, and alkalinity) and selected samples are also analyzed for supplemental analytes (waste water compounds, tritium, gross-alpha/gross-beta radioactivity, radon-222, diesel range organics, gasoline range organics, dissolved hydrocarbon gases, and biological activity reaction tests). The Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) has funded the collection and analysis of additional groundwater samples from deeper aquifers than the statewide program (500 – 1,200 feet). WGQMN activities for the WLCI began with the sampling of 4 wells in the Greater Green River Basin in December 2009. Groundwater samples were collected from another 5 wells in the Greater Green River Basin in September 2011. Groundwater sampling is expected to continue in 2012 at 4-5 additional wells within the WLCI boundary.\",\n",

We used 3 digital layers to select potential sampling points in areas shown as aspen woodland, and in 2008, visited 52 points. Aspen grew at only 16 points (31%). Most incorrectly classified points were in mountain big sagebrush stands, with a few in limber pine or greasewood stands. In 18 aspen stands, we sampled in 24 distinct patches of trees, using a belt transect to collect information about tree size and density, canopy and trunk health, numbers and sizes of fallen logs, and common undergrowth species. We estimated size of the stand, and recorded slope steepness, aspect, position on the landscape, and substrate. Aspen stands occur predominantly on slopes facing north northwest to southeast, generally on upper slopes, and on residual parent materials. Stands are small (half of our stands < 1 ha), generally contain at least 2 distinct patches of trees, and most consist solely of aspen. Densities and sizes of trees vary widely, but small trees (<4.5 feet tall) are the most widespread and densest. Larger trees are less common and grow in much lower densities. Fallen logs suggest that this has long been the case. Small trees are generally vigorous, but larger trees less so. Browsing upon all size classes appears to be light. Two indicators suggest that regeneration of aspens is spotty: aspens < 1 in. dbh reached threshold density of 500 stems / acre in 11 of 24 patches, and aspens > 2 m tall and < 10 cm dbh grew in 15 patches. In 2012, we will sample more stands, modifying our methods to better estimate stand size and to determine whether stands have been expanding or contracting.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Oil and gas development in the western United States is increasingly placing at odds the management of two critical natural resources: fossil fuels and water. Muddy Creek, part of the Upper Colorado River watershed, is a semi-arid catchment in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Muddy Creek flows throughout the year and includes both perennial and ephemeral tributaries. Primary land use includes livestock grazing, oil and gas development, and recreational activities. A multi-discipline study has been initiated to determine potential impacts of the projected increase of coal bed natural gas development. Hundreds of permits for drilling co-produced waters have been issued, but low energy prices have slowed development. A watershed assessment was conducted in 2010 to determine areas within the watershed that are more susceptible to mobilization of trace elements that occur in soils forming on marine shales. Soil, stream sediment, and water samples were collected and analyzed for major elements and a suite of trace elements, with arsenic and selenium identified as potential elements of concern. A study of benthic and riparian invertebrates is being conducted to evaluate the uptake of these elements into the food web at targeted locations in the Muddy Creek watershed. Continued work will address sources of salinity to Muddy Creek, and ultimately to the Upper Colorado River. Impacts from energy development can include mobilization of naturally occurring sulfate salts through soil disturbance. Formation waters currently discharged to the surface from two failed wells within the watershed will be evaluated for their contribution to salinity, as well as dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen species, and trace elements, to the Upper Colorado River. Upon completion, this study will provide a baseline that can assist in land-use management decisions as oil and gas extraction expands in the Upper Colorado River watershed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sagebrush ecosystems occupy a large portion of the western United States and provide unique ecosystem services. However, these systems occur in arid and semiarid areas and are vulnerable to external disturbances such as fire, climate change, and human disturbance. Good understanding of the spatial distribution and change patterns of these ecosystems is vital for land and wildlife management and increased understanding of landscape scale processes. The implementation of new remote sensing protocols allows the monitoring of sagebrush component change over the entire Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) region. Baseline 2006 WLCI predictions of seven cover components (bare ground, herbaceous, litter, shrub, sagebrush, big sagebrush, and Wyoming sagebrush) are estimated using field measurements, QuickBird 2.4m imagery, and Landsat 30m imagery with regression tree models. To analyze the amount of change in the WLCI region between 2006 and 2010, three dates of Landsat imagery (spring, summer, and fall) from each year are compared for change detection analysis. New area predictions from 2010 are compared to the 2006 base predictions to calculate the overall change amounts. Results indicate bare ground decreased by a total area of almost 53 km² from 2006, herbaceous cover decreased by 63 km², big sagebrush decreased by approximately 11 km², and Wyoming big sagebrush decreased by approximately 19 km². On the other hand, litter increased by almost 64 km², shrub (which includes many species in addition to sagebrush) increased by approximately 52 km², and all other species of sagebrush increased by approximately 9 km². Changes were further stratified into three potential change drivers including fire, human induced disturbance, and other change (typically climate variation). Approximately 6% of the change was due to fire, 4% due to human disturbance, and 90% due to other effects such as climate. The precipitation trends of the last four years likely resulted in most of the change that occurred in the other category',\n",

We questioned if a grazing change from herded sheep to season-long free-roaming cattle on the high desert south of the upper Sweetwater River has diminished the region’s wetlands. Areal extent is an ecological indicator for wetlands. We used aerial images (0.3- to 1-m ground sample distance (GSD)) collected at approximately 20-year intervals between 1948 and 2005 to test for decreased wetland area. We used a 2008 aerial survey (systematic, intermittent, nested 1-, 8-, and 18-mm GSD) along 150 km of streams to look for in-stream erosion features. The historical images provided no evidence of a wetland-area trend; however, we show that 1-m GSD imagery is inadequate for detecting regional channel erosion. Eleven named streams were surveyed in 2008 and all but three had headcuts. The three streams without headcuts were either <1,000 m long, or had been remediated. Approximately 90% of scenes showed distinct herbivore trailing. We conclude that active head cutting and channel scouring evident in 2008 images indicates past and on-going loss of wetland/meadow area and water-storage capacity. Given the 2008 evidence of headcut erosion and high herbivore concentration on the region’s riparian systems, we recommend grazing-management changes, headcut remediation, and monitoring the rate of soil organic matter replacement in area meadows and wetlands. We recommend riparian monitoring include systematic, intermittent sampling by acquisition of nested imagery on the order of 1, 8, and 18-mm GSD.',\n",

We questioned whether season-long grazing by free-ranging cattle in the sagebrush ecosystem of the southern upper Sweetwater River drainage, has caused a significant loss of SOM in small, often linear wetlands contributing to perennial feeder streams of the River. In an initial assessment of this question, we measured wetland SOM in the top 25- cm of soil cores taken from inside and outside two fenced exclosures and a >50-year-old private-land pasture (hereafter, exclosure) in three wetlands in the area of interest. The other exclosures were six and nine years old and we collected and analyzed 40 samples from cross-channel transects 10-m above and below exclosure fences. Among all wetland sites (inside and outside), the wetland with the oldest exclosure had the greatest SOM. Across wetlands, SOM inside exclosures averaged 30.7% compared to 23.3% (P = 0.001) outside. We recommend (1) further study of riparian grazing effects on SOM, wetland water storage, and streamflow, (2) SOM monitoring in wetlands grazed by livestock, and (3) that the importance of wetland water storage for mitigating greater peak streamflows and lower late flows, be given much greater consideration in land-management.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Ecotones are transition areas between two ecological communities. Little work has been done in the ecotone between sagebrush/grassland and woodland. The predominate view is that woodlands were historically limited to rocky outcrops and slopes and are moving downhill into the sagebrush/grass communities due to changes in disturbance regimes and management practices. In the study area woodland edges are dominated by limber pine (Pinus flexilis), with subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in the drainages, while further upslope limber pine mixes with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmanni). We used dendrochronology and aerial photography to examine woodland movement on the ecotone from 1681 to 2009 and found a more complex picture of vegetative composition and disturbance than is generally acknowledged. Dendrochronology dated the oldest sample to 1681. Two samples showed fire scars from 1941. Aerial photos from 1949 showed large patches of fresh stand replacement fire with standing dead trees. Within our study area of 23,653 acres, 3,595 acres burned in 1948. Conifer cover (at 95% - closed canopy) was 891 acres in 1949, and 5,359 acres in 2009, an increase of 84%. However, if the 1941 stand replacement burned area is added to the 1949 conifer area, this increase is only 16%. These calculations do not take into account areas of the fire that could not be confidently identified from the aerial photos. We conclude that in this area, the spread of conifers is not a new expansion but rather trees re-occupying areas occupied prior to the 1941 fire. The identification of a 329-year old, lower-slope tree is another indication that limber pine and other conifers were historically present and are not newly-established. When managing ecotones, a long reference timeframe is needed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Wyoming Basins are one of the remaining strongholds of the sagebrush ecosystem. Containing approximately 24 percent of all sagebrush habitats in the United States, this area is an important stronghold for greater sage-grouse and represents a priority ecoregion for conservation planning. However, like most sagebrush habitats, threats to this region are numerous, making conservation actions challenging. The Wyoming Basins provides other significant land uses, including oil, gas, and wind-energy development and accompanying infrastructure necessary for energy transmission. We recently published a new book that adds to current knowledge about the regional status of this sagebrush ecosystem, the distribution of habitats, the threats to the ecosystem, and the influence of threats and habitat conditions on occurrence and abundance of sagebrush associated fauna and flora in the Wyoming Basins. We developed comprehensive methods for data collection and monitoring of wildlife and plant populations, and then integrated field and spatial data into a spatially explicit analytical framework, allowing us to develop models of species occurrence and abundance for the region. This book provides significant new information on distributions, abundances, and habitat relationships for a number of species of conservation concern that depend on sagebrush in the region. The tools and models presented in this book increase our understanding of impacts from land uses and can contribute to the development of comprehensive management and conservation strategies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Understanding potential effects of land uses on ecological resources can help inform management decision making. For instance, density and patterns of energy development may be designed to minimize the effects of surface disturbance on native conditions, such as sagebrush habitat structure and connectivity. Alternatively, certain density and patterns may induce an exponential decline (a tipping point) in native conditions. Identifying land-uses that minimize resource decline and that lead to tipping points (rapid change) helps decision makers determine land uses to promote and to avoid, respectively. We developed a spatially explicit simulation system to evaluate potential effects of land uses on natural resources in SW Wyoming as a means to inform land-use decision making. This system can evaluate a range of possible land uses, and characterize potential effects on natural resources. To date, we’ve exercised the simulation system over a 65 x 64 km energy field designated as high potential for future development. Baseline information consisted of current vegetation, energy infrastructure, and a cheatgrass habitat suitability map. We simulated the development of oil/gas pads and related infrastructure over a 20-yr period and the potential spread of cheatgrass under different assumptions of future climate. We assessed trends in the aerial amount and distribution of cheatgrass and native sagebrush relative to the amount of surface disturbance. Results of this initial assessment illustrated tipping points in the spread of cheatgrass and in the decline of native sagebrush when disturbed area reached about 13% of the energy field. Consistency of this tipping point is being evaluated using larger energy fields. Our initial results, however, begin to illustrate land use patterns that may lead to rapid decline in native conditions, and that limit achieving conservation management goals.',\n",

Increasingly, natural resource planning efforts on watershed scales require the compilation of large amounts of spatial and tabular information. In the past the technology and information for completing these plans have been located in a variety of formats and locations, requiring significant inputs of time, effort, and money to bring them into the planning process. In addition, watershed level planning often used data sources and information that differed significantly from plan to plan, thus making compatibility and comparisons over large spatial extents impossible. The SuiteWater Project is a partnership between the Wyoming Association of Conservation Districts (WACD) and the Wyoming Geographic Information Science Center (WyGISC) aimed at developing a web-based interface to integrate GIS, spatial data, textual information, photography, documents, user generated content, and other information for incorporation into the resource planning process and development of planning documents. To date, the SuiteWater collaboration has produced an informational web portal containing links to water resource planning information, two web-based mapping applications and access to over half a terabyte of spatial data. A public mapping application gives users the ability to explore Wyoming watersheds and quickly obtain key statistics related to a watershed of interest. The WACD member-specific mapping application is a robust and data rich application giving WACD employees access to the tools and data necessary to assist them in the watershed planning process, as well as to meet their day-to-day GIS needs.

       "  'abstract': 'The Muddy Creek watershed, located southwest of Rawlins, Wyoming, is part of ongoing regional coal-bed natural gas development. Although produced waters from gas development are currently being reinjected, releases of treated produced waters are being considered. Muddy Creek is relatively unimpacted by irrigation return flows. We examined the chemistry of Muddy Creek to understand natural processes driving salinity in order to establish a baseline for monitoring change in the watershed resulting from potential produced water additions. Discharge, gauged near Baggs, Wyoming, can vary from 0.005 m3 s -1 to 10 m3 s -1 and is dominated by snowmelt in spring. Stream salinity varies inversely with discharge. Soil water and shallow groundwater inputs carry products of sedimentary rock weathering and are the dominant sources of salinity. Salinity from deeper groundwater issuing from springs and historic failed wells is detectable in certain tributaries, but makes negligible contributions to the main stem of Muddy creek. Stream salinity, as measured by electrical conductivity (EC), has almost doubled for a given discharge rate in recent years. In 2006, stream EC averaged 1.0 mS cm-1 at a discharge of 0.1 m3 s -1 , and in 2011 it averaged 1.9 mS cm-1 . The increase in salinity at a given stream discharge rate appears linked to increased shallow groundwater discharge. Shallow groundwater discharge increases are driven by increases in annual precipitation driving groundwater recharge. However, heavy snowpacks in recent years have also increased low salinity flows in the stream during spring snowmelt. As a result, the average EC for total annual stream discharge has remained relatively constant (0.9 mS cm-1 ). Understanding the nature and magnitude of such fluctuations in baseline natural salinity is crucial to distinguish them from anthropogenic impacts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Muddy Creek ecosystem is unique because the stream contains a distinctive fish assemblage, is physically degraded, and will soon be influenced by coalbed natural gas (CBNG) development. We attempted to separate the effects of existing physical degradation and impending oil and gas development by measuring trace element concentrations in the Muddy Creek food web prior to most energy development. To extract CBNG resources, groundwater must be pumped to the surface. Groundwater produced during CBNG development can contain high concentrations of trace elements and is often discharged into nearby water bodies. Trace elements in produced water can be taken up into food resources and transferred to higher trophic levels in the food web through predation. We collected animals from each trophic level in the Muddy Creek food web above and below impending CBNG inputs and measured tissues for trace element concentrations and δ15N (trophic position). We regressed trophic position against trace element concentration for each organism to examine how trace elements moved through the food web. Aluminum and zinc concentrations in water exceeded chronic standards for aquatic life. Only selenium and mercury bioaccumulated in the Muddy Creek food web, while other trace elements biodiminished (peaked at intermediate trophic levels) or had similar concentrations throughout the food web. By understanding the Muddy Creek ecosystem now, land managers and developers can make informed decisions about management needs and potential mitigation efforts. Our study established baseline conditions in the Muddy Creek food web. We plan to repeat this study in 3-5 years after CBNG development has occurred to compare how trace elements are accumulating in the food web.',\n",

This Executive Order replaced, but essentially reaffirmed, former Governor Freudenthal’s Executive Order 2010-4. This strategy is designed to address the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2010 finding that the Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act. The Service determined that habitat loss and fragmentation and the lack of sufficient regulatory mechanisms supported their finding. The Wyoming core area strategy is designed to address both of these listing factors. A key component of the core area strategy is limiting the density and amount of anthropogenic disturbance allowed within core areas. A process was developed by agency personnel and the Governor’s Sage-Grouse Implementation Team to evaluate proposed anthropogenic projects to determine if the project, together with existing disturbance, exceeds thresholds established by the Executive Order. Projects that result in the thresholds being exceeded are to be rejected, modified, or mitigated. The Density/Disturbance Calculation Tool (DDCT) is the mechanism by which levels of anthropogenic disturbance is determined and compared to the established thresholds. The DDCT process results in better planning and design as project proponents strive to minimize disturbance to stay within the thresholds allowed. A demonstration of the DDCT process will be presented',\n",

We coupled habitat selection and survival models using data from n = 167 female grouse collected in May–August 2008 and 2009. To predict habitat selection, we evaluated relationships between landscape scale environmental and anthropogenic covariates, at 0.25-km, 1-km, and 5-km scales using binary logistic regression to identify the most predictive model combinations to produce resource selection functions (RSFs) for nesting, early and late brood-rearing, and for broodless hens in early and late summer. We combined the RSF’s for each life-stage to form an occurrence layer that spatially identified areas with the highest and lowest relative probability of use in summer. We used proportional hazards modeling to identify the most predictive models for nest, brood, and adult female summer survival to predict survival based on the same landscape covariates and scales that we termed survival probability functions (SPFs). We combined SPF’s into a lambda equation that was mapped on the ARPA to predict habitats that contributed to population sources or sinks. Finally, the occurrence layer and lambda layer were combined to predict selected and non-selected source and sink habitats. Our analysis indicated that 40% of the ARPA was selected-source while 4% was selected-sink habitat. Our results suggest that the primary concern of CBNG development on sage-grouse population persistence in the ARPA is avoidance of otherwise productive habitats. That is, selected-source becoming nonselected-source in habitats with CBNG development. By predicting sink and source habitats we identified areas that should take conservation priority during development to maintain a viable sage-grouse population in the ARPA and a method that can be used in other energy development landscapes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter “sage-grouse”) distribution and abundance in western North America has declined over the last century. Depredation of sage-grouse nest sand predation of chickscan be one of the most influential factors limiting their productivity. Prey species utilize anti-predation behaviors, such as predator avoidance, to reduce the risk of predation. Birds in general balance the dual necessity of selecting cover to hide from visual and olfactory predators to optimize their survival and reproductive success (optimal-hiding strategy), which may also be achieved by selecting habitat with relatively fewer predators. We compared avian predator densities at sage-grouse nests and brood locations to random locations within available sage-grouse habitat. This comparison allowed us to assess the ability of sage-grouse to avoid avian predators during nesting and early brood-rearing. During 2008–2010, we conducted 10-min point-count surveys at 218 sage-grouse nests, 249 sage-grouse brood locations from 83 sage-grouse broods, and 496 random locations. We found that random locations had higher densities of avian predators relative to sage-grouse nest and brood locations. Sagegrouse nested in areas where there were lower densities of Common Ravens (Corvus corax), Black-billed Magpies (Pica hudsonia), Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), and Buteo hawks compared to random locations. Additionally, sage-grouse selected brood rearing locations that had lower densities of the same avian predators as during nesting plus American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) compared to random. By selecting nest and brood-rearing locations with lower avian predator densities, sage-grouse may reduce the risk of nest depredation and predation on eggs, chicks, and hens.',\n",

Preliminary results from five sites within the Bear River drainage suggest that species’ resource use (δ13C) and trophic position (δ15N) varied across sites, though the relative position of fishes to each other remained similar. At sites with northern leatherside chub, redside shiners and speckled dace showed 2-5% enrichment inδ15N, indicating a trophic level increase. Redside shiners and northern leatherside chub were isotopically indistinguishable, indicating no evidence of niche displacement, despite apparent ecological similarity of these two species. These preliminary results suggest that the absence of northern leatherside chub, which were once common in this drainage, may correlate to subtle changes in the overall food web.

       "  'abstract': 'Bird mortality can be greatly reduced if wind energy facilities avoid major migration stopovers and pathways, or implement designs to reduce bird impacts. However, there is a need to identify where these migratory concentration areas are located. In Wyoming, information on the occurrence and ecology of migratory bird species is spread throughout an array of sources, ranging from incidental sightings, migration counts, formal and informal reports, scientific studies, and expert knowledge of particular species. The lack of a concise synthesis of information on migratory birds severely limits the ability of agencies and companies to incorporate this critical knowledge into wind development planning. Our objective was to map migratory bird concentration areas across Wyoming and identify potential conflicts with wind development. Bird species that tend to concentrate migration along narrow routes and at specific stopover areas are the species at highest risk to repeated mortalities from wind turbines. Thus, these “concentrated migrant” species are the focus of this migration mapping project and fall into four general categories: raptors, wetland birds, riparian birds, and sparse grassland birds. Specific information about how typical migrants in each group utilize and fly between stopover areas was based on an extensive literature review and used to develop conceptual models of migration concentration. These conceptual models were validated through expert review and known migration locations. We also modeled where future wind energy development is most likely to occur. Our findings highlight where wind energy facilities may have the least and greatest impacts on migratory birds and where knowledge gaps about migration remain',\n",

Understanding how and why wildlife populations are impacted by such changes is critical for wildlife conservation in the face of a rapidly expanding energy development industry. We examined the abundance of breeding sagebrush songbirds, many of which are displaying substantial range-wide declines, with respect to the density of natural gas wells in the Jonah and Pinedale Anticline fields in western Wyoming, USA. Increased well density was associated with significant decreases in Brewer's, sage, and vesper sparrow but not sage thrasher abundance. From a mechanistic standpoint, nestling masses for most species did not vary with energy development intensity, suggesting little evidence for changes in food availability. However, daily nest survival rates for all three sagebrush-obligate species decreased with well density and proximity to the nearest well pad. Current work is focused on why nest predation rates increased with energy development. We are identifying nest predator species with infrared cameras and comparing predator abundance and diversity across energy development treatments. Understanding the mechanisms underlying energy development effects for songbirds and other species will greatly aid management prescriptions geared towards mitigating impacts of energy development to already declining species.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The U. S. Department of Energy recently proposed that 20% of the electricity generated in the United States will be supplied by wind energy by 2030. Landscapes with high potential for wind energy development often coincide with suitable wintering habitat for pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) where forage is made available by continuously blowing snow. Evaluating the influence of energy development to pronghorn on winter range is particularly critical given that they encounter elevated energetic demands during this time of year. Our study is designed as an impact-reference study, where the effects of wind energy infrastructure on wintering pronghorn are being evaluated at the Dunlap Ranch (DR) impact study area in the Shirley Basin, Wyoming. Our non-impacted reference study area is south of Walcott Junction (WJ), Wyoming. The goals of our study are to compare resource selection and survival for pronghorn that encounter wind energy infrastructure (DR) compared to pronghorn that do not (WJ) over 3 winters (2010, 2010–2011, and 2011–2012). Specific objectives of our study are to 1) use resource selection functions to model, identify, and compare landscape features (anthropogenic and environmental) that best predict pronghorn winter habitat use for each winter on the DR and WJ, 2) evaluate the displacement of pronghorn at DR by wind energy infrastructure components (turbines, access roads, transmission lines, substations), and 3) model survival risk for pronghorn and compare differences in risk based on environmental and anthropogenic variables that influence survival on the DR and WJ. In January 2010 we captured and attached GPS-transmitters to 70 doe pronghorn (35 in the DR and 35 in the WJ). We have been monitoring these animals via fixed-wing flights approximately 5 times per year and have recovered location data from 32 dead pronghorn.

       "  'abstract': 'Migratory ungulates are declining globally, due in large part to anthropogenic disturbance of their migration corridors. Although ungulates can behaviorally adapt to some types of development, the consequences of such behaviors for population performance are unclear. In addition, it is unknown if migration route persistence declines beyond some threshold level of development. We are evaluating the influence of development intensity on the migratory behavior of several western Wyoming ungulate populations. These migration routes span a gradient of development, from pristine wilderness to suburban housing, to habitats intensively developed for energy extraction. We are currently analyzing GPS movement data collected during existing studies on mule deer. We measured for each route: rate of travel through developed areas and rate of travel through undeveloped areas over multiple years representing increasing levels of development, and spring and fall initiation dates. With these migratory behaviors measured for each animal, we then assessed whether such behaviors differed as a function of the level of development occurring along the route by evaluating differences between movement behavior and stopover use in disturbed habitat with high levels of human activity, compared to relatively pristine habitat, with little human activity or disturbance. Our preliminary findings indicate that with increasing levels of development, migrating ungulates alter their behavior to limit their exposure to developed areas. In particular, we found that animals sped up when migrating through developed areas, a behavior that likely diminishes foraging opportunities associated with stopover sites. Study findings will aid the conservation of ungulate migration routes and stopover sites by identifying how landscape connectivity is impeded by development, while furthering our basic understanding of migration ecology.',\n",

Our research focused on summer and winter elk (Cervus elaphus) response to disturbance risk associated with natural gas development, including mechanisms driving resource selection. Our study was based in the 500-km2 Fortification Creek Area of northeastern Wyoming, USA where over 700 coalbed natural gas (CBNG) wells were developed. Elk monitoring in the Fortification Creek Area began in the mid-1990s, before CBNG development, providing us with a temporal control (1992–1995) to elk monitoring during development (2008–2010). Vehicle traffic levels were measured on different road types (e.g., access, link, and well roads) as a metric of CBNG development activity. We used environmental and CBNG development data to develop multiple regression models for summer and winter using 405 VHF locations from 17 cow elk prior to CBNG development and 112,549 GPS locations from 35 cow elk during CBNG development to assess spatial selection shifts. We created models for individual animals and averaged coefficients across individuals to build population level models during years of development. Comparison of elk resource selection before and during CBNG development demonstrated a distributional shift, whereby during development, elk used distance from infrastructure and escape cover to minimize risk. During development elk selected areas with greater conifer cover and away from CBNG roads. Variable coefficients suggest elk avoided development even where activity was low, such as producing well pads with visits limited to maintenance personnel. Reducing traffic levels on both access and link roads could reduce indirect habitat loss by 50–70%. We suggest reducing the human presence surrounding CBNG development through new technologies such as telemetered wells and sustaining undeveloped areas within the development footprint to maintain elk refugia.',\n",

Since then, we have mapped projected distribution of oil, natural gas and wind-power activities and calculated the relative exposure of all SGCN to these activities. Exposure represents how extensively the predicted suitable habitat occurs in proximity to expected development. Preliminary calculations indicate that the top 5 most exposed species are (in decreasing order of exposure): Great Plains Toad, Rocky Mountain Toad, Black-tailed Prairie Dog, Pygmy Rabbit and Wyoming Pocket Gopher. Oil and gas development is the principle route of exposure for each of these species. In contrast, Black-footed Ferret is likely to be most the most exposed SGCN to wind power development, and this exposure is sufficient to make it the sixth most exposed species overall.',\n",

This includes approximately 83 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable natural gas which amounts to almost one-tenth of US natural gas production; a quarter of the world’s proven oil reserves, mostly in oil shale deposits; large reserves of uranium; and the world’s largest reserve of trona. Since the latest energy “boom” in the 2000s, there has been a lack of research on energy development effects on the ranching community. Through an agreement between the Wyoming Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey, a study evaluating ranchers’ perceptions towards energy development was conducted. Surveys were mailed to 860 ranchers operating in Lincoln, Sublette, Uinta, Sweetwater, and Carbon Counties; 205 completed surveys were returned for an overall response rate of 24%. The mail questionnaire focused on the following themes: effects of energy development on quality of life factors; concerns about existing or potential effects to rangelands; challenges to ranching and the ranching industry; direct effects of energy development on ranching operations; perceptions towards land management agencies and decision making processes; and the use of science in policy making processes. Results indicate that energy development is having a negative effect on drugs, crime rates, scenery/views, open space, traffic congestion, affordable housing, and availability of ranching supplies. Energy development is having a positive effect, however, on employment opportunities, salary amount, community economic development, and small business development. The results reflect previous research done in the 1970s in terms of respondents’ perceptions in regards to positive and negative effects of energy development to their community.

In the late 1800’s word of these mineral occurrences spread and Wyoming became the locus and boom of mineral development. Following the Civil War the United States endeavored itself to connect the east coast with the west coast and construction of the transcontinental railroad began. As the grades were leveled and tracks laid, Rail-End towns were established and the first commercial coal mines began production in 1862. The development of these mineral riches set the groundwork, shaped the infrastructure, and brought with it a rich diversity that Wyoming communities experience today. Currently Wyoming coal production accounts for roughly 40 percent of total US production of which nearly 12 million tons of coal is produced in Southwest Wyoming alone. In 2010 state revenue generated from Ad Valorem, Lease sales, Royalties, and Severance taxes on coal reached one billion dollars.',\n",

While studies have quantified effects of invasion on vegetation, soil properties, or biotic interactions, few attempts have been made to simultaneously characterize many aboveground and belowground ecosystem properties of areas invaded by exotic annual bromes. We examined both aboveground and belowground properties in native sagebrush grassland and adjacent areas dominated by exotic annual bromes (B. tectorum L. and Bromus japonicas Thunb.) to better understand the fundamental ecological differences between native and invaded areas, and to better inform restoration needs. Field sites were located in north central Wyoming, and plots were established in areas that had been historically subject to wildfire and either recolonized by native sagebrush grassland vegetation, or invaded by exotic annual bromes. We employed measures of vegetation community structure as well as soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Plots with greater than 20% exotic annual brome cover had significantly less cover of all native vegetation functional groups resulting in lower richness and evenness than native plots. Invaded plots also have more homogeneous plant community according to a multi-scale assessment of community structure. Soils beneath invaded plant communities had higher infiltration rates, higher levels of total nitrogen, and a lower C:N ratio than the native soils. Invaded soils also had 90-96% lower abundance of all soil microbial groups measured. Discriminant analysis indicated a strong separation of both aboveground and belowground characteristics associated with each vegetation type. Regardless of which factors cause these differences on the landscape, restoration efforts should focus on manipulation of ecosystem properties in concert, rather than targeting the presence or ecology of the invasive species alone.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Lands and resources managed by federal agencies provide many goods and services that contribute to the social and economic well-being of local communities and society as a whole. These include such benefits as recreational opportunities, commercial uses, ecosystem services, and subsistence. Management actions on these lands can affect various private and public stakeholders who often have diverse values and preferences about the use and management of public resources. Therefore, these social and economic impacts of planning and management need to be adequately and systematically addressed, particularly in controversial situations where diverse stakeholders are highly engaged and may contest management decisions. USGS scientists have worked with the BLM, NPS, and USFS to develop a web-based decision tool for Assessing Socioeconomic Planning Needs (ASPN) which enables natural resource managers and planners to develop custom socioeconomic assessment plans tailored to their individual land units and specific planning needs. ASPN allows planners and managers to establish the broad social and economic themes they may want to address, identify sub-issues to assess under those broad themes; and determine the intensity of the issues. ASPN then suggests analysis methods for addressing the identified issues using various inputs including time and budget needs. This tool will improve the planning process by: 1) systematically covering the breadth of issues facing land and resource management agencies; 2) identifying and prioritizing the planning issues that will require a social and/or economic analysis in the management plan; 3) providing a range of recommended social and economic methods which could be used to address the identified planning issues 4) realistically accounting for budget and time constraints; 5) including consideration of appropriate regulations regarding environmental policy; and 6) providing justification and documentation of the chosen analysis and tools.',\n",

Featuring eight major programs, this poster will help viewers understand our breadth and capability. The programs are: 1) Surface Water Quality Monitoring – The surface water program’s goal is to maintain vigilance of our water. A network of 54 water quality stations monitors every major stream in the county. The majority of these 54 stations are monitored several times a year, most of them five times; 2) Ground Water Quality Monitoring - The program monitors about 300 groundwater sources. The bulk of sources are domestic water wells, but about 60 industrial and stock water wells on and around the Anticline area are monitored for water levels, physical and chemical parameters, including analysis for hydrocarbons; 3) Range Management Program - The Range program documents use, condition, and trend of the rangelands, particularly in the Boulder, Ryegrass, and North LaBarge Landscapes, as well as a number of individual allotments; 4) Wildlife and Habitat Program - Focusing on Conservation Planning and quantifying environmental services provided by lands within the county, the district Conservation Plans are a comprehensive inventory and planning process done in cooperation with a landowner; 5) Sage-grouse Initiative - To assure the long-term conservation of the bird, the district partners with other entities to employ a scientist whose focus is to work with landowner strategies and infrastructure to improve long-term sustainability of grouse; 6) Conservation Tree Program - Providing trees to landowners at nominal costs, literally thousands of trees populate our private landscapes as result of landowner involvement in the program; 7) Youth Education Program - The District employs a youth education specialist on a part-time basis, carrying the message of conservation to our youth in afterschool and school enrichment programs; and 8) Partnerships - In addition to these Sublette Conservation District initiatives, the district partners with many agencies and individuals to accomplish conservation in the county.',\n",

Water cannot be delivered to homes, businesses, and industries without energy, and most forms of energy development require large amounts of water. The United States faces two significant and sometimes competing challenges: to provide sustainable supplies of freshwater for humans and ecosystems and to ensure adequate sources of energy for future generations. This report reviews the complex ways in which water and energy are interconnected and describes the earth science data collection and research that can help the Nation address these important challenges.\\n\\nThe earth sciences have been a cornerstone in developing our current understanding of the water-energy nexus. A full understanding of the nexus, however, is limited by uncertainty in our knowledge of fundamental issues, such as the quantity of freshwater that is available, the amount of water that is used in energy development, the effects that emerging energy development technologies have on water quality and quantity, and the amount of energy required to treat and deliver freshwater. Enhanced data collection and research can improve our understanding of these important issues and thereby lay the groundwork for informed resource management.\\n\\nRelevant earth science issues analyzed and discussed herein include freshwater availability; water use; ecosystems health; assessment of saline water resources; assessment of fossil-fuel, uranium, and geothermal resources; subsurface injection of wastewater and carbon dioxide and related induced seismicity; climate change and its effect on water availability and energy production; byproducts and waste streams of energy development; emerging energy-development technologies; and energy for water treatment and delivery.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Greater Sage-Grouse, has been observed, hunted, and counted for decades. The sagebrush biome, home to the Greater Sage-Grouse, includes sagebrush-steppe and Great Basin sagebrush communities, interspersed with grasslands, salt flats, badlands, mountain ranges, springs, intermittent creeks and washes, and major river systems, and is one of the most widespread and enigmatic components of Western U.S. landscapes. Over time, habitat conversion, degradation, and fragmentation have accumulated across the entire range such that local conditions as well as habitat distributions at local and regional scales are negatively affecting the long-term persistence of this species. Historic patterns of human use and settlement of the sagebrush ecosystem have contributed to the current condition and status of sage-grouse populations. The accumulation of habitat loss, persistent habitat degradation, and fragmentation by industry and urban infrastructure, as indicated by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) findings, presents a significant challenge for conservation of this species and sustainable management of the sagebrush ecosystem. Because of the wide variations in natural and human history across these landscapes, no single prescription for management of sagebrush ecosystems (including sage-grouse habitats) will suffice to guide the collective efforts of public and private entities to conserve the species and its habitat. This report documents and summarizes several decades of work on sage-grouse populations, sagebrush as habitat, and sagebrush community and ecosystem functions based on the recent assessment and findings of the USFWS under consideration of the Endangered Species Act. As reflected here, some of these topics receive a greater depth of discussion because of the perceived importance of the issue for sagebrush ecosystems and sage-grouse populations. Drawing connections between the direct effects on sagebrush ecosystems and the effect of ecosystem condition on habitat condition, and finally the connection between habitat quality and sage-grouse population dynamics remains an important goal for science, management, and conservation. This effort is necessary, despite the perception that these complicated, indirect relations are difficult to characterize and manage, and the many advances in understanding and application developed toward this end have been documented here to help inform regional planning and policy decisions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Animal habitat selection is an important and expansive area of research in ecology. In particular, the study of habitat selection is critical in habitat prioritization efforts for species of conservation concern. Landscape planning for species is happening at ever‐increasing extents because of the appreciation for the role of landscape‐scale patterns in species persistence coupled to improved datasets for species and habitats, and the expanding and intensifying footprint of human land uses on the landscape. We present a large‐scale collaborative effort to develop habitat selection models across large landscapes and multiple seasons for prioritizing habitat for a species of conservation concern. Greater sage‐grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus, hereafter sage‐grouse) occur in western semi‐arid landscapes in North America. Range‐wide population declines of this species have been documented, and it is currently considered as “warranted but precluded” from listing under the United States Endangered Species Act. Wyoming is predicted to remain a stronghold for sage‐grouse populations and contains approximately 37% of remaining birds. We compiled location data from 14 unique radiotelemetry studies (data collected 1994–2010) and habitat data from high‐quality, biologically relevant, geographic information system (GIS) layers across Wyoming. We developed habitat selection models for greater sage‐grouse across Wyoming for 3 distinct life stages: 1) nesting, 2) summer, and 3) winter. We developed patch and landscape models across 4 extents, producing statewide and regional (southwest, central, northeast) models for Wyoming. Habitat selection varied among regions and seasons, yet preferred habitat attributes generally matched the extensive literature on sage‐grouse seasonal habitat requirements. Across seasons and regions, birds preferred areas with greater percentage sagebrush cover and avoided paved roads, agriculture, and forested areas. Birds consistently preferred areas with higher precipitation in the summer and avoided rugged terrain in the winter. Selection for sagebrush cover varied regionally with stronger selection in the Northeast region, likely because of limited availability, whereas avoidance of paved roads was fairly consistent across regions. We chose resource selection function (RSF) thresholds for each model set (seasonal\\u2009×\\u2009regional combination) that delineated important seasonal habitats for sage‐grouse. Each model set showed good validation and discriminatory capabilities within study‐site boundaries. We applied the nesting‐season models to a novel area not included in model development. The percentage of independent nest locations that fell directly within identified important habitat was not overly impressive in the novel area (49%); however, including a 500‐m buffer around important habitat captured 98% of independent nest locations within the novel area. We also used leks and associated peak male counts as a proxy for nesting habitat outside of the study sites used to develop the models. A 1.5‐km buffer around the important nesting habitat boundaries included 77% of males counted at leks in Wyoming outside of the study sites. Data were not available to quantitatively test the performance of the summer and winter models outside our study sites. The collection of models presented here represents large‐scale resource‐management planning tools that are a significant advancement to previous tools in terms of spatial and temporal resolution.

       "  'abstract': 'Oil and gas development in the western United States is increasingly placing at odds the management of two critical natural resources: fossil fuels and water. Muddy Creek, part of the Upper Colorado River watershed, is a semi-arid catchment in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Muddy Creek flows throughout the year and includes both perennial and ephemeral tributaries. Primary land use includes livestock grazing, oil and gas development, and recreational activities. A multi-discipline study has been initiated to determine potential impacts of the projected increase of coal bed natural gas development. Hundreds of permits for drilling co-produced waters have been issued, but low energy prices have slowed development. A watershed assessment was conducted in 2010 to determine areas within the watershed that are more susceptible to mobilization of trace elements that occur in soils forming on marine shales. Soil, stream sediment, and water samples were collected and analyzed for major elements and a suite of trace elements, with arsenic and selenium identified as potential elements of concern. A study of benthic and riparian invertebrates is being conducted to evaluate the uptake of these elements into the food web at targeted locations in the Muddy Creek watershed. Continued work will address sources of salinity to Muddy Creek, and ultimately to the Upper Colorado River. Impacts from energy development can include mobilization of naturally occurring sulfate salts through soil disturbance. Formation waters currently discharged to the surface from two failed wells within the watershed will be evaluated for their contribution to salinity, as well as dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen species, and trace elements, to the Upper Colorado River. Upon completion, this study will provide a baseline that can assist in land-use management decisions as oil and gas extraction expands in the Upper Colorado River watershed.',\n",

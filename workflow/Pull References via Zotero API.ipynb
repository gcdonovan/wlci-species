    "In this notebook, I'm addressing the problem I raised in a GitHub issue of how to keep things straight between a shared Zotero library and processing to a) establish linkages to the xDD Digital Library and b) extracted data/information from associated xDD documents. I reworked the original process of operating against an export from the Zotero library to one that works against the Zotero API via the pyzotero package.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm breaking this up into a two part exploration. This first part simply runs the process of establishing a linkage on DOI to a corresponding xDD document identifier by putting a link attachment back onto the Zotero library item. That establishes a base of operations for subsequent data extraction processes, keeping everything on established Zotero library items where continued curation can occur via web or desktop clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "To operate this code, you will need to establish the ZOTERO_API_KEY environment variable in your Python environment. That key is tied to a given user account that has read/write permissions to the WLCI Library Group (established with the group ID parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This same idea should apply for any other Zotero library where we want to run the same overall process of linking a library reference to an xDD digital NLP representation. In the second part of this experiment, I will pick up from the established \"xDD Document Link\" identifier, pull back a list of associated species scientific names, and put those into a child attachment of the xDD Document Link attachment. This then begins to lay out structured annotation retrieved via algorithms directly into the Zotero library items, adding value to those items and using the Zotero library as a living cloud-based repository with both human and software generated value."

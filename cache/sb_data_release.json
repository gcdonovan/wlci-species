                "body": "The U.S. Geological Survey, along with scientists from Rutgers University, collected water chemistry, electromagnetic, redox-potential, dissolved oxygen, water flow rate, and water temperature data along stream and river corridors in multiple sub-watersheds of the East River Science Focus Area (SFA) near Crested Butte, CO. The concept of \u2018river corridor\u2019 science recognizes that the quality of flowing surface waters is intrinsically linked to their contributing catchments through hydrologic connectivity, including lower terrestrial hillslopes, floodplains, and riparian zones. Bidirectional river-floodplain exchange in particular can be critical to basin water storage and nutrient transformation dynamics, yet floodplain hydrologic exchange flows are often driven primarily by episodic high-flow events or relatively slow-exchanging, long hyporheic flowpaths. Beaver (Castor canadensis) disrupt these abiotic floodplain exchange drivers by actively diverting large quantities of channel water laterally using an engineered series of dams, impacting both wet and dry season floodplain connection. As beaver ponds and seepage zones accompanying beaver activity often exhibit suboxic to hypoxic conditions, there is the potential to mobilize reduced metals from alluvial sediments to streams and rivers. The data contained in this release can be used to assess beaver-induced physical and chemical river-floodplain exchange."

                "body": "The Fuels Guide and Database for Big Sagebrush Ecological Sites was developed as part of the Joint Fire Sciences Program project \"Quantifying and predicting fuels and the effects of reduction treatments along successional and invasion gradients in sagebrush habitats\" (Shinneman and others, 2015). The research was carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center and Boise State University researchers, in partnership with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Idaho Army National Guard. Most of the research for the project focused on the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (hereafter the NCA) in southern Idaho. Sagebrush shrublands in the NCA, and throughout much of the Great Basin and Snake River Plain, are highly influenced by non-native plants that alter successional trajectories, suppress native species, and promote frequent wildfire. Fine-fuel loadings created by nonnative annual grasses and forbs can be highly variable through space and time, which can increase uncertainty when predicting fire risk and behavior. The overarching goal of the research project was to explore and develop different approaches to better quantify and predict these dynamic fuel loadings, as well as the effects of fuels manipulations in sagebrush habitats. The purpose of this database is to provide a tool that allows ready access to fuel loading data across a range of conditions, from relatively intact sagebrush-bunchgrass communities to degraded communities dominated by nonnative annual grasses and forbs. The Fuels Guide and Database (FGD) is a tool designed to assist land managers in estimating fuel loads within a specific stand of vegetation, under conditions ranging from sagebrush-dominated to nonnative, annual grass/forb-dominated communities. Users can query the database based on vegetation cover, vegetation height, and specific environmental variables (for example elevation, precipitation, temperature, soil surface texture, and ecological site) and return fuel loading data that match the query parameters. The FGD also allows users to view photos by point or plot and to individually exclude certain points or plots to help identify areas that best match the current conditions. Final results can be exported to Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or summarized in Microsoft Word reports that can be used to improve estimates of fuel loadings in the field. Fuels data were collected on the NCA, and therefore extrapolation of queried results should also only be applied to the NCA and similar regional environments. However, there is potential for additional cover data, vegetation height data, and fuels data to be added to the FGD. If you are interested in contributing data to the FGD please contact the USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center (fresc_outreach@usgs.gov). With additional input from other users, the Fuels Guide and Database has the potential to be a powerful tool throughout the sagebrush shrublands to assist land managers in quickly estimating fuel loadings.<br>\n<br>\nShinneman, D.J., Pilliod, D.S., Arkle, R.S., and Glenn, N.F., 2015, Quantifying and predicting fuels and the effects of reduction treatments along successional and invasion gradients in sagebrush habitats: Joint Fire Science Program, p. 1-44.<br>\n<br>\nPlease contact fresc_outreach@usgs.gov if you have difficulty downloading the data files.

                "body": "Successful adaptive management hinges largely upon integrating new and improved sources of information as they become available. Updating management tools for greater sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>, hereafter referred to as \u201csage-grouse\u201d) populations, which are indicators for the large-scale health of sagebrush (<em>Artemisia spp.</em>) ecosystems in the Great Basin of North America, provide a timely example for this tenet. Recently developed spatially-explicit habitat maps derived from empirical data played a key role in the conservation of this species facing listing under the Endangered Species Act. Herein, this report provides an updated process for mapping relative habitat suitability and management categories for sage-grouse in Nevada and northeastern California (Coates and others, 2014, 2016). These updates included: 1) adding radio-and GPS telemetry locations from sage-grouse monitored at multiple sites during 2014 to the original location dataset beginning in 1998; 2) integrating output from high resolution maps (1 \u2013 2 m 2) of sagebrush and pinyon-juniper cover as covariates in resource selection models; 3) explicit modeling of relative habitat suitability during three seasons (breeding, brood-rearing, over-wintering) critical to sage-grouse life history; 4) accounting for differences in habitat availability between more mesic sagebrush steppe communities in the northern part of the study area and drier Great Basin sagebrush in more southerly regions by categorizing continuous region-wide surfaces of habitat suitability index (HSI) with independent locations falling within two hydrological flood zones; 5) integrating the three seasonal maps into a composite map of annual relative habitat suitability; 6) deriving updated land management categories based on previously determined cut-points for intersections of habitat suitability and an updated index of sage-grouse abundance and space-use (AUI), and 7) masking urban footprints and major roadways out of the final map products. Seasonal habitat maps were generated based on model-averaged resource selection functions derived for 10 project areas (813 grouse, 14,085 locations) during the breeding season, 10 during the brood-rearing season (591, 11,743), and 7 during the winter season (288, 4,862). RSF surfaces were transformed to HSIs and averaged in a GIS framework for each pixel for each season. Validation analyses of categorized HSI surfaces using a suite of independent datasets resulted in an agreement of 93\u201397 percent for habitat versus non-habitat on an annual basis. Breeding and brood rearing maps validated similarly well at 94-97 percent, while winter maps validated slightly less accurately at 87-93 percent. We provide an updated example of how space use models can be integrated with habitat models to help inform conservation planning. Using data, we combined probabilistic breeding density with a non-linear probability of occurrence relative to distance to nearest lek (traditional breeding ground) using count data to calculate the AUI. The AUI was then classified into two categories of use (high and low-to-no) and intersected with the HSI categories to create potential management prioritization scenarios based on information about sage-grouse occupancy coupled with habitat suitability. The spatially explicit data herein provide updated measures (in comparison to Coates et al. 2014, 2016) of areal extent (i.e., acres) classified within the four habitat suitability and four management categories. Importantly, seasonal and annual maps represent habitat for all age and sex classes of sage-grouse (that is; sample sizes of marked grouse were insufficient to only construct models for reproductive females). This revised sage-grouse habitat mapping product helps improve adaptive application of conservation planning tools based on intersections of spatially-explicit habitat suitability, abundance, and space use indices.<br>\n<br>\nREFERENCES: Coates, P.S., Casazza, M.L., Brussee, B.E., Ricca, M.A., Gustafson, K.B., Overton, C.T., Sanchez-Chopitea, E., Kroger, T., Mauch, K., Niell, L., Howe, K., Gardner, S., Espinosa, S., and Delehanty, D.J. 2014, Spatially explicit modeling of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat in Nevada and northeastern California\u2014A decision-support tool for management: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2014-1163, 83 p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20141163.

To inform greater sage-grouse conservation planning, the researchers developed greater sage-grouse habitat management categories based on habitat selection indices (HSI) and greater sage-grouse abundance and space-use index (AUI).

                "body": "Greater sage-grouse ( \n<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>; hereinafter, sage-grouse) are a sagebrush obligate species that has declined concomitantly with the loss and fragmentation of sagebrush ecosystems across most of its geographical range. The species has been considered for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act multiple times, and was most recently ruled to not warrant protection as of September 2015. Nevertheless, the species faces threats from increasing wildfire frequency and changing climate, which are identified&nbsp;frequently as two environmental drivers contributing to declines of sage-grouse populations. To help inform a threat assessment within the Great Basin for listing sage-grouse in 2015 under the ESA, we conducted an extensive analysis of wildfire and climatic effects on sage-grouse population growth derived from 30 years of lek-count data collected across the hydrographic Great Basin of Western North America. Annual (1984\u20132013) patterns of wildfire were derived from an extensive dataset of remotely sensed 30-meter imagery and precipitation derived from locally downscaled spatially explicit data. In the sagebrush ecosystem, underlying soil conditions also contribute strongly to variation in resilience to disturbance and resistance to plant community changes (R&amp;R). Thus, we developed predictions from models of post-wildfire recovery and chronic effects of wildfire based on three spatially explicit R&amp;R classes derived from soil moisture and temperature regimes. We found evidence of an interaction between the effects of wildfire (chronically affected burned area within 5 kilometers of a lek) and climatic conditions (spring through fall precipitation) after accounting for a consistent density-dependent effect. Specifically, burned areas near leks nullifies population growth that normally follows years with relatively high precipitation. In models, this effect results in long-term population declines for sage-grouse despite cyclic periods of high precipitation. Based on 30-year projections of burn and recovery rates, our population model predicted steady and substantial long-term declines in population size across the Great Basin. Further, example management scenarios that may help offset adverse wildfire effects are provided by models of varying levels of fire suppression and post-wildfire restoration that focus on areas especially important to sage-grouse populations. These models illustrate how sage-grouse population persistence likely will be compromised as sagebrush ecosystems and sage-grouse habitat are degraded by wildfire, especially in a warmer and drier climate, and by invasion of annual grasses that can increase wildfire frequency and size in the Great Basin."

                "body": "Expanding human enterprise across remote environments impacts many wildlife species, including sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>), an indicator species whose decline is at the center of national conservation strategies and land use policies. Anthropogenic resources provide subsidies for generalist predators, potentially leading to cascading effects on sensitive prey species at lower trophic levels. In semi-arid western ecosystems, common ravens (<em>Corvus corax</em>) are expanding in distribution and abundance, and may be negatively affecting sage-grouse reproductive success at broad spatial scales. Ravens are a common predator of sage-grouse nests, and potentially prey on chicks as well. This research aimed to address the growing demand for information about potential interactions between subsidized predators (i.e. ravens) and species they prey upon. More specifically, our objectives were to disentangle natural and anthropogenic influences on raven occurrence at a landscape scale, and provide spatially explicit models and scientific products to help inform decisions regarding the management of ravens and conservation of sage-grouse. Using Bayesian hierarchical occupancy models, we mapped the broad-scale occurrence of common ravens as a function of natural and anthropogenic landscape covariates using more than 15,000 point count surveys performed during 2007\u20132016 within the Great Basin region, USA. In addition, we provide spatially explicit model-predicted surfaces that integrate anthropogenic and natural effects on raven occurrence with underlying information about breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach meets several objectives with respect to the conservation and management of sage-grouse and ravens. First, we established landscape-level patterns of predicted raven occurrence across the Great Basin region. Second, we determined associations between anthropogenic and natural features, and the broad-scale occurrence of ravens. Third, we identified regions where A) high predicted raven occurrence overlapped with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas, and B) areas where raven occurrence was strongly influenced by anthropogenic (vs. natural) variables overlapping with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach can guide management decisions where subsidized predators overlap sensitive prey habitats. For example, management applications could focus on reducing raven access to anthropogenic subsidies in areas where elevated raven occurrence coincides with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas and appears to be largely driven by anthropogenic factors, while prioritizing habitat improvements for sage-grouse elsewhere. Our approach is applicable to other species where widespread survey data are available.<br>\n<br>\nThese data support the following publication:<br>\nO\u2019Neil, S.T., Coates, P.S., Brussee, B.E., Jackson, P.J., Howe, K.B., Moser, A.M., Foster, L.J., and Delehanty, D.J. 2018, Broad-scale occurrence of a subsidized avian predator: reducing impacts of ravens on sage-grouse and other sensitive prey. <em>Journal of Applied Ecology&nbsp;</em>"

Greater sage-grouse population change (percent change) in a high oil and gas development, low population estimate scenario, and with no effects of climate change (2006-2062)<br>\n<br>\nThe oil and gas development scenario were based on an energy footprint model that simulates well, pad, and road patterns for oil and gas recovery options that vary in well types (vertical and directional) and number of wells per pad and use simulation results to quantify physical and wildlife-habitat impacts. I applied the model to assess tradeoffs among 10 conventional and directional-drilling scenarios in a natural gas field in southwestern Wyoming (see Garman 2017).<br>\n<br>\nThe effects climate change on sagebrush were developed using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM, version 4) climate model and representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario (emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century). The projected climate scenario was used to estimate the change in percent cover of sagebrush (see Homer et al. 2015).<br>\n<br>\nThe percent changes in sage-grouse population sizes represented in these data are modeled using an individual-based population model that simulates dynamics of populations by tracking movements of individuals in dynamically changing landscapes, as well as the fates of individuals as influenced by spatially heterogeneous demography.<br>\n<br>\nWe developed a case study to assess how spatially explicit individual based modeling could be used to evaluate future population outcomes of gradual landscape change from multiple stressors. For Greater sage-grouse in southwest Wyoming, we projected oil and gas development footprints and climate-induced vegetation changes fifty years into the future. Using a time-series of planned oil and gas development and predicted climate-induced changes in vegetation, we re-calculated habitat selection maps to dynamically modify future habitat quantity, quality, and configuration. We simulated long-term sage-grouse responses to habitat change by allowing individuals to adjust to shifts in habitat availability and quality. The use of spatially explicit individual-based modeling offered an important means of evaluating delayed indirect impacts of landscape change on wildlife population outcomes.

                "body": "Successful adaptive management hinges largely upon integrating new and improved sources of information as they become available. Updating management tools for greater sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>, hereafter referred to as \u201csage-grouse\u201d) populations, which are indicators for the large-scale health of sagebrush (<em>Artemisia spp.</em>) ecosystems in the Great Basin of North America, provide a timely example for this tenet. Recently developed spatially-explicit habitat maps derived from empirical data played a key role in the conservation of this species facing listing under the Endangered Species Act. Herein, this report provides an updated process for mapping relative habitat suitability and management categories for sage-grouse in Nevada and northeastern California (Coates and others, 2014, 2016). These updates included: 1) adding radio-and GPS telemetry locations from sage-grouse monitored at multiple sites during 2014 to the original location dataset beginning in 1998; 2) integrating output from high resolution maps (1 \u2013 2 m 2) of sagebrush and pinyon-juniper cover as covariates in resource selection models; 3) explicit modeling of relative habitat suitability during three seasons (breeding, brood-rearing, over-wintering) critical to sage-grouse life history; 4) accounting for differences in habitat availability between more mesic sagebrush steppe communities in the northern part of the study area and drier Great Basin sagebrush in more southerly regions by categorizing continuous region-wide surfaces of habitat suitability index (HSI) with independent locations falling within two hydrological flood zones; 5) integrating the three seasonal maps into a composite map of annual relative habitat suitability; 6) deriving updated land management categories based on previously determined cut-points for intersections of habitat suitability and an updated index of sage-grouse abundance and space-use (AUI), and 7) masking urban footprints and major roadways out of the final map products. Seasonal habitat maps were generated based on model-averaged resource selection functions derived for 10 project areas (813 grouse, 14,085 locations) during the breeding season, 10 during the brood-rearing season (591, 11,743), and 7 during the winter season (288, 4,862). RSF surfaces were transformed to HSIs and averaged in a GIS framework for each pixel for each season. Validation analyses of categorized HSI surfaces using a suite of independent datasets resulted in an agreement of 93\u201397 percent for habitat versus non-habitat on an annual basis. Breeding and brood rearing maps validated similarly well at 94-97 percent, while winter maps validated slightly less accurately at 87-93 percent. We provide an updated example of how space use models can be integrated with habitat models to help inform conservation planning. Using data, we combined probabilistic breeding density with a non-linear probability of occurrence relative to distance to nearest lek (traditional breeding ground) using count data to calculate the AUI. The AUI was then classified into two categories of use (high and low-to-no) and intersected with the HSI categories to create potential management prioritization scenarios based on information about sage-grouse occupancy coupled with habitat suitability. The spatially explicit data herein provide updated measures (in comparison to Coates et al. 2014, 2016) of areal extent (i.e., acres) classified within the four habitat suitability and four management categories. Importantly, seasonal and annual maps represent habitat for all age and sex classes of sage-grouse (that is; sample sizes of marked grouse were insufficient to only construct models for reproductive females). This revised sage-grouse habitat mapping product helps improve adaptive application of conservation planning tools based on intersections of spatially-explicit habitat suitability, abundance, and space use indices.<br>\n<br>\nREFERENCES: Coates, P.S., Casazza, M.L., Brussee, B.E., Ricca, M.A., Gustafson, K.B., Overton, C.T., Sanchez-Chopitea, E., Kroger, T., Mauch, K., Niell, L., Howe, K., Gardner, S., Espinosa, S., and Delehanty, D.J. 2014, Spatially explicit modeling of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat in Nevada and northeastern California\u2014A decision-support tool for management: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2014-1163, 83 p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20141163.

This study provides timely and highly useful information about greater sage-grouse over a large area of the Great Basin. USGS researchers and their colleagues created a template for combining landscape-scale occurrence or abundance data with habitat selection data in order to identify areas most critical to sustaining populations of species of conservation concern. The template also identifies those areas where land use changes have minimal impact. To inform greater sage-grouse conservation planning, the researchers developed greater sage-grouse habitat management categories based on habitat selection indices (HSI) and greater sage-grouse abundance and space-use index (AUI). When integrated, these two information layers can delineate where prime grouse habitat overlaps with highest grouse abundance, and thus identify areas of conservation priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br> \n<br> These data support the following publication:\n<br> \n<br> Coates, P.S., Casazza, M.L., Brussee, B.E., Ricca, M.A., Gustafson, K.B., Overton, C.T., Sanchez-Chopitea, E., Kroger, T., Mauch, K., Niell, L., Howe, K., Gardner, S., Espinosa, S., and Delehanty, D.J., 2014, Spatially explicit modeling of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat in Nevada and northeastern California\u2014A decision-support tool for management: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2014-1163, 83 p., \n<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20141163\"><u>http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20141163</u></a>\n<br> \n<br> &nbsp;"

                "body": "Greater sage-grouse ( \n<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>; hereinafter, sage-grouse) are a sagebrush obligate species that has declined concomitantly with the loss and fragmentation of sagebrush ecosystems across most of its geographical range. The species has been considered for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act multiple times, and was most recently ruled to not warrant protection as of September 2015. Nevertheless, the species faces threats from increasing wildfire frequency and changing climate, which are identified&nbsp;frequently as two environmental drivers contributing to declines of sage-grouse populations. To help inform a threat assessment within the Great Basin for listing sage-grouse in 2015 under the ESA, we conducted an extensive analysis of wildfire and climatic effects on sage-grouse population growth derived from 30 years of lek-count data collected across the hydrographic Great Basin of Western North America. Annual (1984\u20132013) patterns of wildfire were derived from an extensive dataset of remotely sensed 30-meter imagery and precipitation derived from locally downscaled spatially explicit data. In the sagebrush ecosystem, underlying soil conditions also contribute strongly to variation in resilience to disturbance and resistance to plant community changes (R&amp;R). Thus, we developed predictions from models of post-wildfire recovery and chronic effects of wildfire based on three spatially explicit R&amp;R classes derived from soil moisture and temperature regimes. We found evidence of an interaction between the effects of wildfire (chronically affected burned area within 5 kilometers of a lek) and climatic conditions (spring through fall precipitation) after accounting for a consistent density-dependent effect. Specifically, burned areas near leks nullifies population growth that normally follows years with relatively high precipitation. In models, this effect results in long-term population declines for sage-grouse despite cyclic periods of high precipitation. Based on 30-year projections of burn and recovery rates, our population model predicted steady and substantial long-term declines in population size across the Great Basin. Further, example management scenarios that may help offset adverse wildfire effects are provided by models of varying levels of fire suppression and post-wildfire restoration that focus on areas especially important to sage-grouse populations. These models illustrate how sage-grouse population persistence likely will be compromised as sagebrush ecosystems and sage-grouse habitat are degraded by wildfire, especially in a warmer and drier climate, and by invasion of annual grasses that can increase wildfire frequency and size in the Great Basin."

                "body": "Expanding human enterprise across remote environments impacts many wildlife species, including sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>), an indicator species whose decline is at the center of national conservation strategies and land use policies. Anthropogenic resources provide subsidies for generalist predators, potentially leading to cascading effects on sensitive prey species at lower trophic levels. In semi-arid western ecosystems, common ravens (<em>Corvus corax</em>) are expanding in distribution and abundance, and may be negatively affecting sage-grouse reproductive success at broad spatial scales. Ravens are a common predator of sage-grouse nests, and potentially prey on chicks as well. This research aimed to address the growing demand for information about potential interactions between subsidized predators (i.e. ravens) and species they prey upon. More specifically, our objectives were to disentangle natural and anthropogenic influences on raven occurrence at a landscape scale, and provide spatially explicit models and scientific products to help inform decisions regarding the management of ravens and conservation of sage-grouse. Using Bayesian hierarchical occupancy models, we mapped the broad-scale occurrence of common ravens as a function of natural and anthropogenic landscape covariates using more than 15,000 point count surveys performed during 2007\u20132016 within the Great Basin region, USA. In addition, we provide spatially explicit model-predicted surfaces that integrate anthropogenic and natural effects on raven occurrence with underlying information about breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach meets several objectives with respect to the conservation and management of sage-grouse and ravens. First, we established landscape-level patterns of predicted raven occurrence across the Great Basin region. Second, we determined associations between anthropogenic and natural features, and the broad-scale occurrence of ravens. Third, we identified regions where A) high predicted raven occurrence overlapped with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas, and B) areas where raven occurrence was strongly influenced by anthropogenic (vs. natural) variables overlapping with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach can guide management decisions where subsidized predators overlap sensitive prey habitats. For example, management applications could focus on reducing raven access to anthropogenic subsidies in areas where elevated raven occurrence coincides with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas and appears to be largely driven by anthropogenic factors, while prioritizing habitat improvements for sage-grouse elsewhere. Our approach is applicable to other species where widespread survey data are available.<br>\n<br>\nThese data support the following publication:<br>\nO\u2019Neil, S.T., Coates, P.S., Brussee, B.E., Jackson, P.J., Howe, K.B., Moser, A.M., Foster, L.J., and Delehanty, D.J. 2018, Broad-scale occurrence of a subsidized avian predator: reducing impacts of ravens on sage-grouse and other sensitive prey. <em>Journal of Applied Ecology&nbsp;</em>"

I applied the model to assess tradeoffs among 10 conventional and directional-drilling scenarios in a natural gas field in southwestern Wyoming (see Garman 2017).<br>\n<br>\nThe effects climate change on sagebrush were developed using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM, version 4) climate model and representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario (emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century). The projected climate scenario was used to estimate the change in percent cover of sagebrush (see Homer et al. 2015).<br>\n<br>\nThe percent changes in sage-grouse population sizes represented in these data are modeled using an individual-based population model that simulates dynamics of populations by tracking movements of individuals in dynamically changing landscapes, as well as the fates of individuals as influenced by spatially heterogeneous demography.<br>\n<br>\nWe developed a case study to assess how spatially explicit individual based modeling could be used to evaluate future population outcomes of gradual landscape change from multiple stressors. For Greater sage-grouse in southwest Wyoming, we projected oil and gas development footprints and climate-induced vegetation changes fifty years into the future. Using a time-series of planned oil and gas development and predicted climate-induced changes in vegetation, we re-calculated habitat selection maps to dynamically modify future habitat quantity, quality, and configuration. We simulated long-term sage-grouse responses to habitat change by allowing individuals to adjust to shifts in habitat availability and quality. The use of spatially explicit individual-based modeling offered an important means of evaluating delayed indirect impacts of landscape change on wildlife population outcomes.

Between 1996 and 2016, we necropsied 127 apparently healthy pelagic olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) that died from drowning bycatch in fisheries and 44 live or freshly dead stranded turtles from the west coast of North and Central America and Hawaii. Seven % (9/127) of pelagic and 47% (21/44) of stranded turtles had renal granulomas associated with S. Typhimurium. Stranded animals were 12 times more likely than pelagic animals to have Salmonella-induced nephritis suggesting that Salmonella may have been a contributing cause of stranding. S. Typhimurium was the only Salmonella serovar detected in L. olivacea, and phylogenetic analysis from whole genome sequencing showed that the isolates from L. olivacea formed a single clade distinct from other S. Typhimurium. Molecular clock analysis revealed that this novel clade may have originated as recently as a few decades ago. The phylogenetic lineage leading to this group is enriched for non-synonymous changes within the genomic area of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 suggesting that these genes are important for host adaptation."

                "body": "Successful adaptive management hinges largely upon integrating new and improved sources of information as they become available. Updating management tools for greater sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>, hereafter referred to as \u201csage-grouse\u201d) populations, which are indicators for the large-scale health of sagebrush (<em>Artemisia spp.</em>) ecosystems in the Great Basin of North America, provide a timely example for this tenet. Recently developed spatially-explicit habitat maps derived from empirical data played a key role in the conservation of this species facing listing under the Endangered Species Act. Herein, this report provides an updated process for mapping relative habitat suitability and management categories for sage-grouse in Nevada and northeastern California (Coates and others, 2014, 2016). These updates included: 1) adding radio-and GPS telemetry locations from sage-grouse monitored at multiple sites during 2014 to the original location dataset beginning in 1998; 2) integrating output from high resolution maps (1 \u2013 2 m 2) of sagebrush and pinyon-juniper cover as covariates in resource selection models; 3) explicit modeling of relative habitat suitability during three seasons (breeding, brood-rearing, over-wintering) critical to sage-grouse life history; 4) accounting for differences in habitat availability between more mesic sagebrush steppe communities in the northern part of the study area and drier Great Basin sagebrush in more southerly regions by categorizing continuous region-wide surfaces of habitat suitability index (HSI) with independent locations falling within two hydrological flood zones; 5) integrating the three seasonal maps into a composite map of annual relative habitat suitability; 6) deriving updated land management categories based on previously determined cut-points for intersections of habitat suitability and an updated index of sage-grouse abundance and space-use (AUI), and 7) masking urban footprints and major roadways out of the final map products. Seasonal habitat maps were generated based on model-averaged resource selection functions derived for 10 project areas (813 grouse, 14,085 locations) during the breeding season, 10 during the brood-rearing season (591, 11,743), and 7 during the winter season (288, 4,862). RSF surfaces were transformed to HSIs and averaged in a GIS framework for each pixel for each season. Validation analyses of categorized HSI surfaces using a suite of independent datasets resulted in an agreement of 93\u201397 percent for habitat versus non-habitat on an annual basis. Breeding and brood rearing maps validated similarly well at 94-97 percent, while winter maps validated slightly less accurately at 87-93 percent. We provide an updated example of how space use models can be integrated with habitat models to help inform conservation planning. Using data, we combined probabilistic breeding density with a non-linear probability of occurrence relative to distance to nearest lek (traditional breeding ground) using count data to calculate the AUI. The AUI was then classified into two categories of use (high and low-to-no) and intersected with the HSI categories to create potential management prioritization scenarios based on information about sage-grouse occupancy coupled with habitat suitability. The spatially explicit data herein provide updated measures (in comparison to Coates et al. 2014, 2016) of areal extent (i.e., acres) classified within the four habitat suitability and four management categories. Importantly, seasonal and annual maps represent habitat for all age and sex classes of sage-grouse (that is; sample sizes of marked grouse were insufficient to only construct models for reproductive females). This revised sage-grouse habitat mapping product helps improve adaptive application of conservation planning tools based on intersections of spatially-explicit habitat suitability, abundance, and space use indices.<br>\n<br>\nREFERENCES: Coates, P.S., Casazza, M.L., Brussee, B.E., Ricca, M.A., Gustafson, K.B., Overton, C.T., Sanchez-Chopitea, E., Kroger, T., Mauch, K., Niell, L., Howe, K., Gardner, S., Espinosa, S., and Delehanty, D.J. 2014, Spatially explicit modeling of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat in Nevada and northeastern California\u2014A decision-support tool for management: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2014-1163, 83 p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20141163.

This study provides timely and highly useful information about greater sage-grouse over a large area of the Great Basin. USGS researchers and their colleagues created a template for combining landscape-scale occurrence or abundance data with habitat selection data in order to identify areas most critical to sustaining populations of species of conservation concern. The template also identifies those areas where land use changes have minimal impact. To inform greater sage-grouse conservation planning, the researchers developed greater sage-grouse habitat management categories based on habitat selection indices (HSI) and greater sage-grouse abundance and space-use index (AUI).

                "body": "Greater sage-grouse ( \n<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>; hereinafter, sage-grouse) are a sagebrush obligate species that has declined concomitantly with the loss and fragmentation of sagebrush ecosystems across most of its geographical range. The species has been considered for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act multiple times, and was most recently ruled to not warrant protection as of September 2015. Nevertheless, the species faces threats from increasing wildfire frequency and changing climate, which are identified&nbsp;frequently as two environmental drivers contributing to declines of sage-grouse populations. To help inform a threat assessment within the Great Basin for listing sage-grouse in 2015 under the ESA, we conducted an extensive analysis of wildfire and climatic effects on sage-grouse population growth derived from 30 years of lek-count data collected across the hydrographic Great Basin of Western North America. Annual (1984\u20132013) patterns of wildfire were derived from an extensive dataset of remotely sensed 30-meter imagery and precipitation derived from locally downscaled spatially explicit data. In the sagebrush ecosystem, underlying soil conditions also contribute strongly to variation in resilience to disturbance and resistance to plant community changes (R&amp;R). Thus, we developed predictions from models of post-wildfire recovery and chronic effects of wildfire based on three spatially explicit R&amp;R classes derived from soil moisture and temperature regimes. We found evidence of an interaction between the effects of wildfire (chronically affected burned area within 5 kilometers of a lek) and climatic conditions (spring through fall precipitation) after accounting for a consistent density-dependent effect. Specifically, burned areas near leks nullifies population growth that normally follows years with relatively high precipitation. In models, this effect results in long-term population declines for sage-grouse despite cyclic periods of high precipitation. Based on 30-year projections of burn and recovery rates, our population model predicted steady and substantial long-term declines in population size across the Great Basin. Further, example management scenarios that may help offset adverse wildfire effects are provided by models of varying levels of fire suppression and post-wildfire restoration that focus on areas especially important to sage-grouse populations. These models illustrate how sage-grouse population persistence likely will be compromised as sagebrush ecosystems and sage-grouse habitat are degraded by wildfire, especially in a warmer and drier climate, and by invasion of annual grasses that can increase wildfire frequency and size in the Great Basin."

                "body": "Expanding human enterprise across remote environments impacts many wildlife species, including sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>), an indicator species whose decline is at the center of national conservation strategies and land use policies. Anthropogenic resources provide subsidies for generalist predators, potentially leading to cascading effects on sensitive prey species at lower trophic levels. In semi-arid western ecosystems, common ravens (<em>Corvus corax</em>) are expanding in distribution and abundance, and may be negatively affecting sage-grouse reproductive success at broad spatial scales. Ravens are a common predator of sage-grouse nests, and potentially prey on chicks as well. This research aimed to address the growing demand for information about potential interactions between subsidized predators (i.e. ravens) and species they prey upon. More specifically, our objectives were to disentangle natural and anthropogenic influences on raven occurrence at a landscape scale, and provide spatially explicit models and scientific products to help inform decisions regarding the management of ravens and conservation of sage-grouse. Using Bayesian hierarchical occupancy models, we mapped the broad-scale occurrence of common ravens as a function of natural and anthropogenic landscape covariates using more than 15,000 point count surveys performed during 2007\u20132016 within the Great Basin region, USA. In addition, we provide spatially explicit model-predicted surfaces that integrate anthropogenic and natural effects on raven occurrence with underlying information about breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach meets several objectives with respect to the conservation and management of sage-grouse and ravens. First, we established landscape-level patterns of predicted raven occurrence across the Great Basin region. Second, we determined associations between anthropogenic and natural features, and the broad-scale occurrence of ravens. Third, we identified regions where A) high predicted raven occurrence overlapped with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas, and B) areas where raven occurrence was strongly influenced by anthropogenic (vs. natural) variables overlapping with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach can guide management decisions where subsidized predators overlap sensitive prey habitats. For example, management applications could focus on reducing raven access to anthropogenic subsidies in areas where elevated raven occurrence coincides with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas and appears to be largely driven by anthropogenic factors, while prioritizing habitat improvements for sage-grouse elsewhere. Our approach is applicable to other species where widespread survey data are available.<br>\n<br>\nThese data support the following publication:<br>\nO\u2019Neil, S.T., Coates, P.S., Brussee, B.E., Jackson, P.J., Howe, K.B., Moser, A.M., Foster, L.J., and Delehanty, D.J. 2018, Broad-scale occurrence of a subsidized avian predator: reducing impacts of ravens on sage-grouse and other sensitive prey. <em>Journal of Applied Ecology&nbsp;</em>"

I applied the model to assess tradeoffs among 10 conventional and directional-drilling scenarios in a natural gas field in southwestern Wyoming (see Garman 2017).<br>\n<br>\nThe effects climate change on sagebrush were developed using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM, version 4) climate model and representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario (emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century). The projected climate scenario was used to estimate the change in percent cover of sagebrush (see Homer et al. 2015).<br>\n<br>\nThe percent changes in sage-grouse population sizes represented in these data are modeled using an individual-based population model that simulates dynamics of populations by tracking movements of individuals in dynamically changing landscapes, as well as the fates of individuals as influenced by spatially heterogeneous demography.<br>\n<br>\nWe developed a case study to assess how spatially explicit individual based modeling could be used to evaluate future population outcomes of gradual landscape change from multiple stressors. For Greater sage-grouse in southwest Wyoming, we projected oil and gas development footprints and climate-induced vegetation changes fifty years into the future. Using a time-series of planned oil and gas development and predicted climate-induced changes in vegetation, we re-calculated habitat selection maps to dynamically modify future habitat quantity, quality, and configuration. We simulated long-term sage-grouse responses to habitat change by allowing individuals to adjust to shifts in habitat availability and quality. The use of spatially explicit individual-based modeling offered an important means of evaluating delayed indirect impacts of landscape change on wildlife population outcomes.

An eddy covariance system measured half-hourly CO2, H2O and sensible and latent heat fluxes, air temperature and pressure, wind speed and direction, soil moisture and rainfall. A Multi-GAS instrument measured (1 Hz frequency) atmospheric H2O, CO2 and H2S volumetric mixing ratios, air pressure, temperature and relative humidity and wind speed and direction. Soil CO2 fluxes and temperature profiles were also measured on a grid using the accumulation chamber method and thermocouple probes, respectively. These data were used to derive hydrothermal CO2 and heat emission rates and characterize the chemical compositions of fumarole and soil-gas emissions. The eddy covariance, Multi-GAS and soil CO2 flux and temperature data sets are saved in spreadsheets in the *.csv format."

                "body": "This dataset is focused on alpine plant species presence/absence, species turnover, and trends in species abundance on four mountain summits in Glacier National Park, Montana, USA from 2003 through 2014. Two summit sites were established in 2003 on Dancing Lady and Bison Mountain, east of the continental divide. Two additional summit sites were established in 2004 on Pitamakin and Mt. Seward, also east of the continental divide. This multi-summit approach to monitoring alpine plant species follows the protocols of the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments (GLORIA) that were initiated by the University of Vienna in 2000 and which have been refined and revised since then. GLORIA summit sites now exist throughout the world. Current protocols are available at: https://gloria.ac.at/downloads/manual. Plant surveys took place every five years during peak alpine plant growing season in late July and August on all aspects of the summits using a combination of area surveys and meter plots. Temperature loggers were buried 10 cm in the substrate on each summit aspect and the highest point of the summit area. The loggers recorded temperature at hourly intervals and were replaced every 3-5 years. Nearly continuous temperatures for some loggers were obtained from 2003 through 2018. To better track interannual variability, another band of plots was established below the summit plots in 2010 for Dancing Lady and 2011 for Pitamakin. These were surveyed every year until 2014. A total of 189 species were recorded for the four summit sites. Preliminary results indicated species turnover rates of 0-36% at the five year interval, and 6-55% at the ten year interval. Annual turnover rates for the lower bands on Dancing Lady and Pitamakin were 2-18%. The NE aspects were most species rich and S aspects had the greatest turnover rates. Little difference was evident as a function of elevation. Additional surveys are planned for the summer of 2019."

                "body": "Invasive species are a subset of non-native (or nonindigenous) species, and knowing what species are non-native to a region is a first step to managing invasive species. People have been compiling non-native and invasive species lists ever since these species started causing harm, yet national non-native species lists are neither universal, nor common. Non-native species lists serve diverse purposes: watch lists for preventing invasions, inventory and monitoring lists for research and modeling, regulatory lists for species control, and nonregulatory lists for raising awareness. This diversity of purpose and the lists\u2019 variation in geographic scope make compiling comprehensive lists of established (or naturalized) species for large regions difficult. However, listing what species are non-native in an area helps in calculating Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), which are&nbsp;measurements required&nbsp;for studying, reporting, and managing environmental problems (McGeoch and Squires, 2015,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://invasionevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MonitoringBiologicalInvasions.TechnicalReport.pdf\">http://invasionevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MonitoringBiologicalInvasions.TechnicalReport.pdf</a>). Measuring invasive species EBVs is needed to mount an effective response to established non-native species. The intent, though not a guarantee, is to update the list in an ongoing way as non-native species become established in, or are eliminated from, the United States. The list has been used to annotate non-native species occurrence records in the U.S. Geological Survey all-taxa mapping application, Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON, <a href=\"https://bison.usgs.gov\">https://bison.usgs.gov</a>).<br>\nAs of 2018-07-26, 1,166 authoritative sources were reviewed to compile the first comprehensive non-native species list for three large regions of the United States: Alaska, Hawaii, and the conterminous United States (lower 48 States), and the list contains 11,344 unique names: 598 taxa for Alaska, 5,848 taxa for Hawaii, and 6,675 taxa for the conterminous United States.&nbsp;"

                "body": "Defining the pre-European range of vegetation communities can enhance our understanding of the role soil, hydrology, and climate had on climax plant communities within southwest Louisiana. Coastal prairie grasslands were in a perpetual state of succession due to two primary disturbances; grazing, primarily by bison and other ungulates, and fires ignited by lightning and Native Americans. Along its borders, prairie vegetation blended into adjacent plant communities forming biologically diverse ecotones that may have fluctuated between a prairie, marsh, or forest dominated community as a result of variable conditions including climate cycles, disturbance and soil characteristics. Since European settlement, this landscape has undergone dramatic change with less than 1% of intact coastal prairie remaining. Conservation entities across the Western Gulf Coastal Plain are taking a collaborative, strategic, landscape scale approach to to conservation to enhance biotic and abiotic communities including pollinators.&nbsp;<br>\nThis effort encourages communication and implementation of restoration and habitat enhancement actions within water sheds. We have produced a spatial dataset which considers landscape position and soil type, based on Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) data, to predict appropriate vegetation associations for plantings across southwest Louisiana based on expert elicitation, and historic references. Methods to produce this product begin with soil boundaries and identification information using Map Unit Keys (MUKEY) which were gathered from SSURGO data (Soil Survey Staff, NRCS 2017). Each mukey number was reviewed on the SOIL WEB to obtain information about components. Components include the proportion and general geomorphic features associated with soil series. Natural vegetation associations were examined and documented for each soil series individually using multiple references, including USDA Soil Series descriptions, expert elicitation, and historical spatial references. Professional reference maps contributed to this spatial dataset and include an 1863 work by Henry L. Abbot and numerous General Land Office surveyor maps and surveyor descriptions from the early 1800s drawn at the scale of a township. General vegetation categories associated with Soil Types (Mukey) were derived from reviewing the vegetation associations of the dominant components, or soil series. These general categories include: anthropogenic, prairie, transition, forest, marsh, swamp, uncertain, and water. Anthropogenic categories were generally due to significant dredging, or other industrial activities. Transitional areas included savannas and areas which may have significantly changed from prairie to forest dominated communities due to rainfall and/or fire frequency and intensity. Forest and swamp includes a range of forest types from which the distinction between these two categories primarily depend upon relative elevation and hydrology. There were a few soil series in which we are uncertain of their pre-settlement vegetation. These areas are anomalies on the landscape and include salt domes and old, disjunct river meanders which are largely comprised of Pleistocene soils and were most likely marais, yet currently much of it is heavily forested as bottomlands, and we are therefore uncertain if this result is solely due to absence of fire. Attribute data include MUKEYs within the parishes which are included in the Louisiana portion of the Gulf Coastal Plain Ecoregion. Information in the table includes symbols, common names, and components which were compiled from SSURGO dataset and Soil Web online resources (Soil Survey Staff, NRCS, accessed 2/2017).

Many assessments of wildlife resource use do not account for missing data, either assuming data loss is random or because a lack of practical treatment for systematic data loss. Several studies have explored how the environment, technological features, and animal behavior influence rates of missing data in GPS telemetry, but previous spatially explicit models developed to correct for sampling bias have been specified to small study areas, on a small range of data loss, or to be species-specific, limiting their general utility. Here we explore environmental effects on GPS fix acquisition rates across a wide range of environmental conditions and detection rates for bias correction of terrestrial GPS-derived, large mammal habitat use. We also evaluate patterns in missing data that relate to potential animal activities that change the orientation of the antennae and characterize home-range probability of GPS detection for 4 focal species; cougars (Puma concolor), desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus ssp. nelsoni) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus)."

From 1998 to 2000, sampling occurred on 8000 km2 in the northern extent of the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE), whereas systematic and consistent, ecosystem-wide sampling occurred in 2004 and 2009\u20132012. In total, there were 6160 confirmed grizzly bear detections, leading to the identification of 1115 unique individual genotypes (520 male, 595 female). The data contain the genotypes or partial genotypes of those 1115 individuals, with an individual ID, sex, and up to 24 genotyped, codominant loci. The loci represented are; G10J, G1A, G10B, G1D, G10H, G10M, G10P, G10C, CXX110, CXX20, G10L, MU50, MU59, G10U, MU23, G10X, REN145.P07, MSUT2, CPH9, MU51, REN144.A06, MU26, D123, D1A. Each locus is split into two columns, the first of which contains the first allele and the second of which contains the second allele of each genotyped locus for each individual. Values within the columns of each locus represent the size of the alleles."

                "body": "For several decades, grizzly bear (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) populations in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) and the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE) have increased in numbers and range extent. Whereas the NCDE population is contiguous with grizzly bear populations in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, genetic evidence suggests the GYE population remains isolated. Recent analyses indicate the effective population size of GYE grizzly bears has increased and is approaching levels needed for long-term viability. With only ~110 km distance separating current estimates of occupied range for these populations, the potential for immigration into the GYE from an NCDE migrant, or vice versa, is likely greater now than it has been for many decades. Therefore, we sought to delineate potential movement paths providing connectivity for male-mediated gene flow between the two populations. Using GPS locations for 124 male grizzly bears monitored during 199 bear-years, and covariates describing ecological, physical, and anthropogenic features of the landscape, we first developed step-selection functions to generate conductance layers of bear movements for each ecosystem. We then used randomized shortest path (RSP) algorithms to estimate the average number of net passages for all grid cells in the study region, when moving from an origin to a destination node. Given the conductance layer, movement paths follow certain grid cell sequences more than others and resulting RSP values thus provide a measure of movement potential. Repeating this process for 100 pairs of random origin and destination nodes, we identified movement paths for 3 levels of random deviation (<em>\u0398</em>) from the least-cost path. We observed broad-scale concordance between model predictions for paths originating in the NCDE and those originating in the GYE for all 3 levels of movement exploration. Our model predictions indicate that grizzly bear movement between the ecosystems could involve a variety of routes, and verified observations of grizzly bears outside occupied range support this finding.<br>\n&nbsp;"

Using snags that were created by topping mature Douglas-fir trees (Pseudotsuga menziesii) as part of the OSU College of Forestry Integrated Research Project, we measured characteristics of 731 snags and quantified foraging and breeding use of snags by birds 25-27 years after their creation. We also examined whether different harvest treatments (i.e., group selection, two-story, clearcut) and snag configurations (i.e., scattered and clustered) influenced snag characteristics or avian use for foraging and nesting. In addition, we conducted point count and call play-back surveys to calculate naive occupancy estimates for cavity-nesting bird species."

                "body": "The Fuels Guide and Database for Big Sagebrush Ecological Sites was developed as part of the Joint Fire Sciences Program project \"Quantifying and predicting fuels and the effects of reduction treatments along successional and invasion gradients in sagebrush habitats\" (Shinneman and others, 2015). The research was carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center and Boise State University researchers, in partnership with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Idaho Army National Guard. Most of the research for the project focused on the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (hereafter the NCA) in southern Idaho. Sagebrush shrublands in the NCA, and throughout much of the Great Basin and Snake River Plain, are highly influenced by non-native plants that alter successional trajectories, suppress native species, and promote frequent wildfire. Fine-fuel loadings created by nonnative annual grasses and forbs can be highly variable through space and time, which can increase uncertainty when predicting fire risk and behavior. The overarching goal of the research project was to explore and develop different approaches to better quantify and predict these dynamic fuel loadings, as well as the effects of fuels manipulations in sagebrush habitats. The purpose of this database is to provide a tool that allows ready access to fuel loading data across a range of conditions, from relatively intact sagebrush-bunchgrass communities to degraded communities dominated by nonnative annual grasses and forbs. The Fuels Guide and Database (FGD) is a tool designed to assist land managers in estimating fuel loads within a specific stand of vegetation, under conditions ranging from sagebrush-dominated to nonnative, annual grass/forb-dominated communities. Users can query the database based on vegetation cover, vegetation height, and specific environmental variables (for example elevation, precipitation, temperature, soil surface texture, and ecological site) and return fuel loading data that match the query parameters. The FGD also allows users to view photos by point or plot and to individually exclude certain points or plots to help identify areas that best match the current conditions. Final results can be exported to Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or summarized in Microsoft Word reports that can be used to improve estimates of fuel loadings in the field. Fuels data were collected on the NCA, and therefore extrapolation of queried results should also only be applied to the NCA and similar regional environments. However, there is potential for additional cover data, vegetation height data, and fuels data to be added to the FGD. If you are interested in contributing data to the FGD please contact the USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center (fresc_outreach@usgs.gov). With additional input from other users, the Fuels Guide and Database has the potential to be a powerful tool throughout the sagebrush shrublands to assist land managers in quickly estimating fuel loadings.<br>\n<br>\nShinneman, D.J., Pilliod, D.S., Arkle, R.S., and Glenn, N.F., 2015, Quantifying and predicting fuels and the effects of reduction treatments along successional and invasion gradients in sagebrush habitats: Joint Fire Science Program, p. 1-44.<br>\n<br>\nPlease contact fresc_outreach@usgs.gov if you have difficulty downloading the data files.

The pixel values range from 0 to100 with an overall mean value of 7.1 and a standard deviation of +/-10.5. The model's test mean error rate (n = 1670), based on nine different randomizations, equals 4.9% with a standard deviation of +/- 0.15. This dataset was generated by integrating ground-truth measurements of annual herbaceous percent cover with 250-m spatial resolution eMODIS NDVI satellite derived data and geophysical variables into regression-tree software. The geographic coverage includes the Great Basin, the Snake River Plain, the state of Wyoming, and contiguous areas. We applied a mask to areas above 2250-m elevation because annual grasses are unlikely to exist at substantial cover above this threshold. To target likely sagebrush ecosystems, the mask also hid pixels classified as something other than shrub or grassland/herbaceous by the 2011 National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is the most common annual grass in the study area. It grows from seed, usually in spring, matures quickly, produces seed, and dies. After dying, cheatgrass contributes fine fuels that faciliate fire ignition and spread throughout sagebrush ecosystems. These fires remove sagebrush stands. Increasing fire return intervals, land management practices, and development have all contributed to the fragmentation of the once expansive sagebrush ecosystems. These ecosystems are critical for water quality, reduced fire threats, and the survival of sagebrush-dependent wildlife."

We integrated this data to create a time series of spatially explicit predictions of herbaceous annual vegetation cover in sagebrush ecosystems, with an emphasis on annual grasses. Annual grass cover in sagebrush ecosystems is highly variable year-to-year because it is strongly dependent on highly variable weather patterns, particularly precipitation timing and totals. Annual grass cover also reflects past disturbances and management decisions. We produced 17 consecutive years (2000 \u2013 2016) of herbaceous annual vegetation cover data in 1% cover increments, which allows extensive analyses of annual grass dynamics. Annual grasses, especially cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), result in grass-fire cycles that endanger human-built structures, reduce air quality, and compromise hunting resources by destroying wildlife habitat. These sagebrush ecosystems, whose character and composition are dramatically altered, are critical for water quality and the survival of sagebrush-dependent wildlife. The geographic coverage of the study area includes the Great Basin, the Snake River Plain, the state of Wyoming, and contiguous areas. We applied a mask to areas above 2250 m elevation because annual grasses are unlikely to exist at substantial cover at or above this threshold (Boyte et al. 2016. doi: 10.1016/j.rama.2016.03.002). To target likely sagebrush ecosystems, the same mask also covered pixels classified as something other than shrub or grassland/herbaceous by the National Land Cover Database(NLCD). For the study area, the annual herbaceous cover mean for the 17-year period equaled 7.31% with a standard deviation of 7.03%. The study area's mean pixel value for the study period ranged from 0-96%, although individual years' pixel values reached 100%.

Uncontrolled wildfire in arid and semiarid ecosystems has become an increasing concern in recent decades. Active rehabilitation of fire-affected areas is often quickly initiated to minimize long-term ecosystem damage. However, the complex soil-geomorphic-vegetation patterns and low and variable moisture conditions in these regions makes restoration challenging. To further inform these post-fire management decisions, we present results from 5-years of vegetation and sediment flux monitoring following the Milford Flat Fire in west-central Utah, USA. Our sampling design includes monitoring plots in areas not burned, areas burned but where no rehabilitation was attempted, and burned areas where various rehabilitation approaches were implemented. At each of the 25 plots, vegetation cover and composition data were collected annually, and wind-driven sediment flux was measured using passive dust traps."

Potential impacts include the alteration of fuel loads and fire regimes, as well as the competitive displacement of native plant populations. Both of these impacts can significantly degrade habitat quality for wildlife and can have important socioeconomic consequences for human society. To design science-based strategies for mitigating these impacts, managers need information on the relative abundance of invasive plant populations over time and across complex landscapes characterized by multiple management jurisdictions, a range of urban and wildland settings, and diverse biophysical environments. These data consist of areas modeled as containing early season invasives (ESI) such as cheatgrass, red bromem, and African Mustard across Washington County, Utah for 2001 through 2010. Multi-season (spring and summer) satellite imagery (Landsat 5) were used to model the potential extent and distribution of these species. A mapping algorithm toolset, Detection of Early Season Invasives (DESI), which works in conjuction with the ENVI image analysis and processing software, was used throughout the process. Specifically, DESI compares spring and summer Landsat images and models the abundance of ESI as a function in seasonal differences in vegetation greeness."

                "body": "Successful adaptive management hinges largely upon integrating new and improved sources of information as they become available. Updating management tools for greater sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>, hereafter referred to as \u201csage-grouse\u201d) populations, which are indicators for the large-scale health of sagebrush (<em>Artemisia spp.</em>) ecosystems in the Great Basin of North America, provide a timely example for this tenet. Recently developed spatially-explicit habitat maps derived from empirical data played a key role in the conservation of this species facing listing under the Endangered Species Act. Herein, this report provides an updated process for mapping relative habitat suitability and management categories for sage-grouse in Nevada and northeastern California (Coates and others, 2014, 2016). These updates included: 1) adding radio-and GPS telemetry locations from sage-grouse monitored at multiple sites during 2014 to the original location dataset beginning in 1998; 2) integrating output from high resolution maps (1 \u2013 2 m 2) of sagebrush and pinyon-juniper cover as covariates in resource selection models; 3) explicit modeling of relative habitat suitability during three seasons (breeding, brood-rearing, over-wintering) critical to sage-grouse life history; 4) accounting for differences in habitat availability between more mesic sagebrush steppe communities in the northern part of the study area and drier Great Basin sagebrush in more southerly regions by categorizing continuous region-wide surfaces of habitat suitability index (HSI) with independent locations falling within two hydrological flood zones; 5) integrating the three seasonal maps into a composite map of annual relative habitat suitability; 6) deriving updated land management categories based on previously determined cut-points for intersections of habitat suitability and an updated index of sage-grouse abundance and space-use (AUI), and 7) masking urban footprints and major roadways out of the final map products. Seasonal habitat maps were generated based on model-averaged resource selection functions derived for 10 project areas (813 grouse, 14,085 locations) during the breeding season, 10 during the brood-rearing season (591, 11,743), and 7 during the winter season (288, 4,862). RSF surfaces were transformed to HSIs and averaged in a GIS framework for each pixel for each season. Validation analyses of categorized HSI surfaces using a suite of independent datasets resulted in an agreement of 93\u201397 percent for habitat versus non-habitat on an annual basis. Breeding and brood rearing maps validated similarly well at 94-97 percent, while winter maps validated slightly less accurately at 87-93 percent. We provide an updated example of how space use models can be integrated with habitat models to help inform conservation planning. Using data, we combined probabilistic breeding density with a non-linear probability of occurrence relative to distance to nearest lek (traditional breeding ground) using count data to calculate the AUI. The AUI was then classified into two categories of use (high and low-to-no) and intersected with the HSI categories to create potential management prioritization scenarios based on information about sage-grouse occupancy coupled with habitat suitability. The spatially explicit data herein provide updated measures (in comparison to Coates et al. 2014, 2016) of areal extent (i.e., acres) classified within the four habitat suitability and four management categories. Importantly, seasonal and annual maps represent habitat for all age and sex classes of sage-grouse (that is; sample sizes of marked grouse were insufficient to only construct models for reproductive females). This revised sage-grouse habitat mapping product helps improve adaptive application of conservation planning tools based on intersections of spatially-explicit habitat suitability, abundance, and space use indices.<br>\n<br>\nREFERENCES: Coates, P.S., Casazza, M.L., Brussee, B.E., Ricca, M.A., Gustafson, K.B., Overton, C.T., Sanchez-Chopitea, E., Kroger, T., Mauch, K., Niell, L., Howe, K., Gardner, S., Espinosa, S., and Delehanty, D.J. 2014, Spatially explicit modeling of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat in Nevada and northeastern California\u2014A decision-support tool for management: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2014-1163, 83 p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20141163.

This study provides timely and highly useful information about greater sage-grouse over a large area of the Great Basin. USGS researchers and their colleagues created a template for combining landscape-scale occurrence or abundance data with habitat selection data in order to identify areas most critical to sustaining populations of species of conservation concern. The template also identifies those areas where land use changes have minimal impact. To inform greater sage-grouse conservation planning, the researchers developed greater sage-grouse habitat management categories based on habitat selection indices (HSI) and greater sage-grouse abundance and space-use index (AUI).

Encroachment of these trees into sagebrush ecosystems of the Great Basin can present a threat to populations of greater sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>). These data provide land managers and other interested parties with a high-resolution representation of conifers within the geographic range of the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment of greater sage-grouse that can be used for a variety of management and research applications.<br>\n<br>\nWe mapped conifer trees at 1 x 1 meter resolution across the extent of all Nevada Department of Wildlife Bi-State Sage-grouse Population Management Units plus a 10 km buffer. Using 2010 and 2013 National Agriculture Imagery Program digital orthophoto quads (DOQQs) as our reference imagery, we applied object-based image analysis with Feature Analyst software (Overwatch, 2013) to classify conifer features across our study extent. This method relies on machine learning algorithms that extract features from imagery based on their spectral and spatial signatures.

                "body": "Greater sage-grouse ( \n<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>; hereinafter, sage-grouse) are a sagebrush obligate species that has declined concomitantly with the loss and fragmentation of sagebrush ecosystems across most of its geographical range. The species has been considered for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act multiple times, and was most recently ruled to not warrant protection as of September 2015. Nevertheless, the species faces threats from increasing wildfire frequency and changing climate, which are identified&nbsp;frequently as two environmental drivers contributing to declines of sage-grouse populations. To help inform a threat assessment within the Great Basin for listing sage-grouse in 2015 under the ESA, we conducted an extensive analysis of wildfire and climatic effects on sage-grouse population growth derived from 30 years of lek-count data collected across the hydrographic Great Basin of Western North America. Annual (1984\u20132013) patterns of wildfire were derived from an extensive dataset of remotely sensed 30-meter imagery and precipitation derived from locally downscaled spatially explicit data. In the sagebrush ecosystem, underlying soil conditions also contribute strongly to variation in resilience to disturbance and resistance to plant community changes (R&amp;R). Thus, we developed predictions from models of post-wildfire recovery and chronic effects of wildfire based on three spatially explicit R&amp;R classes derived from soil moisture and temperature regimes. We found evidence of an interaction between the effects of wildfire (chronically affected burned area within 5 kilometers of a lek) and climatic conditions (spring through fall precipitation) after accounting for a consistent density-dependent effect. Specifically, burned areas near leks nullifies population growth that normally follows years with relatively high precipitation. In models, this effect results in long-term population declines for sage-grouse despite cyclic periods of high precipitation. Based on 30-year projections of burn and recovery rates, our population model predicted steady and substantial long-term declines in population size across the Great Basin. Further, example management scenarios that may help offset adverse wildfire effects are provided by models of varying levels of fire suppression and post-wildfire restoration that focus on areas especially important to sage-grouse populations. These models illustrate how sage-grouse population persistence likely will be compromised as sagebrush ecosystems and sage-grouse habitat are degraded by wildfire, especially in a warmer and drier climate, and by invasion of annual grasses that can increase wildfire frequency and size in the Great Basin."

Qualitative assessment methods outlined by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) were used to develop tract boundaries and to assign a level of mineral-resource potential and certainty to each tract. The general process included (1) identifying possible mineral deposit types for locatable commodities specified by BLM for each focal area, (2) outlining those areas that potentially contained mineral deposits based on geology, mineral occurrences, geophysics, soil and stream-sediment geochemistry, alteration mineral assemblages inferred from satellite imagery, BLM claims and permit data, mineral-exploration activity, and existing mineral-resource assessment data, and (3) evaluating the level of mineral-resource potential and level of certainty associated with the outlined areas using BLM assessment categories.

                "body": "Expanding human enterprise across remote environments impacts many wildlife species, including sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>), an indicator species whose decline is at the center of national conservation strategies and land use policies. Anthropogenic resources provide subsidies for generalist predators, potentially leading to cascading effects on sensitive prey species at lower trophic levels. In semi-arid western ecosystems, common ravens (<em>Corvus corax</em>) are expanding in distribution and abundance, and may be negatively affecting sage-grouse reproductive success at broad spatial scales. Ravens are a common predator of sage-grouse nests, and potentially prey on chicks as well. This research aimed to address the growing demand for information about potential interactions between subsidized predators (i.e. ravens) and species they prey upon. More specifically, our objectives were to disentangle natural and anthropogenic influences on raven occurrence at a landscape scale, and provide spatially explicit models and scientific products to help inform decisions regarding the management of ravens and conservation of sage-grouse. Using Bayesian hierarchical occupancy models, we mapped the broad-scale occurrence of common ravens as a function of natural and anthropogenic landscape covariates using more than 15,000 point count surveys performed during 2007\u20132016 within the Great Basin region, USA. In addition, we provide spatially explicit model-predicted surfaces that integrate anthropogenic and natural effects on raven occurrence with underlying information about breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach meets several objectives with respect to the conservation and management of sage-grouse and ravens. First, we established landscape-level patterns of predicted raven occurrence across the Great Basin region. Second, we determined associations between anthropogenic and natural features, and the broad-scale occurrence of ravens. Third, we identified regions where A) high predicted raven occurrence overlapped with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas, and B) areas where raven occurrence was strongly influenced by anthropogenic (vs. natural) variables overlapping with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach can guide management decisions where subsidized predators overlap sensitive prey habitats. For example, management applications could focus on reducing raven access to anthropogenic subsidies in areas where elevated raven occurrence coincides with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas and appears to be largely driven by anthropogenic factors, while prioritizing habitat improvements for sage-grouse elsewhere. Our approach is applicable to other species where widespread survey data are available.<br>\n<br>\nThese data support the following publication:<br>\nO\u2019Neil, S.T., Coates, P.S., Brussee, B.E., Jackson, P.J., Howe, K.B., Moser, A.M., Foster, L.J., and Delehanty, D.J. 2018, Broad-scale occurrence of a subsidized avian predator: reducing impacts of ravens on sage-grouse and other sensitive prey. <em>Journal of Applied Ecology&nbsp;</em>"

For Greater sage-grouse in southwest Wyoming, we projected oil and gas development footprints and climate-induced vegetation changes fifty years into the future. Using a time-series of planned oil and gas development and predicted climate-induced changes in vegetation, we re-calculated habitat selection maps to dynamically modify future habitat quantity, quality, and configuration. We simulated long-term sage-grouse responses to habitat change by allowing individuals to adjust to shifts in habitat availability and quality. The use of spatially explicit individual-based modeling offered an important means of evaluating delayed indirect impacts of landscape change on wildlife population outcomes.

                "body": "Successful adaptive management hinges largely upon integrating new and improved sources of information as they become available. Updating management tools for greater sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>, hereafter referred to as \u201csage-grouse\u201d) populations, which are indicators for the large-scale health of sagebrush (<em>Artemisia spp.</em>) ecosystems in the Great Basin of North America, provide a timely example for this tenet. Recently developed spatially-explicit habitat maps derived from empirical data played a key role in the conservation of this species facing listing under the Endangered Species Act. Herein, this report provides an updated process for mapping relative habitat suitability and management categories for sage-grouse in Nevada and northeastern California (Coates and others, 2014, 2016). These updates included: 1) adding radio-and GPS telemetry locations from sage-grouse monitored at multiple sites during 2014 to the original location dataset beginning in 1998; 2) integrating output from high resolution maps (1 \u2013 2 m 2) of sagebrush and pinyon-juniper cover as covariates in resource selection models; 3) explicit modeling of relative habitat suitability during three seasons (breeding, brood-rearing, over-wintering) critical to sage-grouse life history; 4) accounting for differences in habitat availability between more mesic sagebrush steppe communities in the northern part of the study area and drier Great Basin sagebrush in more southerly regions by categorizing continuous region-wide surfaces of habitat suitability index (HSI) with independent locations falling within two hydrological flood zones; 5) integrating the three seasonal maps into a composite map of annual relative habitat suitability; 6) deriving updated land management categories based on previously determined cut-points for intersections of habitat suitability and an updated index of sage-grouse abundance and space-use (AUI), and 7) masking urban footprints and major roadways out of the final map products. Seasonal habitat maps were generated based on model-averaged resource selection functions derived for 10 project areas (813 grouse, 14,085 locations) during the breeding season, 10 during the brood-rearing season (591, 11,743), and 7 during the winter season (288, 4,862). RSF surfaces were transformed to HSIs and averaged in a GIS framework for each pixel for each season. Validation analyses of categorized HSI surfaces using a suite of independent datasets resulted in an agreement of 93\u201397 percent for habitat versus non-habitat on an annual basis. Breeding and brood rearing maps validated similarly well at 94-97 percent, while winter maps validated slightly less accurately at 87-93 percent. We provide an updated example of how space use models can be integrated with habitat models to help inform conservation planning. Using data, we combined probabilistic breeding density with a non-linear probability of occurrence relative to distance to nearest lek (traditional breeding ground) using count data to calculate the AUI. The AUI was then classified into two categories of use (high and low-to-no) and intersected with the HSI categories to create potential management prioritization scenarios based on information about sage-grouse occupancy coupled with habitat suitability. The spatially explicit data herein provide updated measures (in comparison to Coates et al. 2014, 2016) of areal extent (i.e., acres) classified within the four habitat suitability and four management categories. Importantly, seasonal and annual maps represent habitat for all age and sex classes of sage-grouse (that is; sample sizes of marked grouse were insufficient to only construct models for reproductive females). This revised sage-grouse habitat mapping product helps improve adaptive application of conservation planning tools based on intersections of spatially-explicit habitat suitability, abundance, and space use indices.<br>\n<br>\nREFERENCES: Coates, P.S., Casazza, M.L., Brussee, B.E., Ricca, M.A., Gustafson, K.B., Overton, C.T., Sanchez-Chopitea, E., Kroger, T., Mauch, K., Niell, L., Howe, K., Gardner, S., Espinosa, S., and Delehanty, D.J. 2014, Spatially explicit modeling of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat in Nevada and northeastern California\u2014A decision-support tool for management: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2014-1163, 83 p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20141163.

This study provides timely and highly useful information about greater sage-grouse over a large area of the Great Basin. USGS researchers and their colleagues created a template for combining landscape-scale occurrence or abundance data with habitat selection data in order to identify areas most critical to sustaining populations of species of conservation concern. The template also identifies those areas where land use changes have minimal impact. To inform greater sage-grouse conservation planning, the researchers developed greater sage-grouse habitat management categories based on habitat selection indices (HSI) and greater sage-grouse abundance and space-use index (AUI).

                "body": "Greater sage-grouse ( \n<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>; hereinafter, sage-grouse) are a sagebrush obligate species that has declined concomitantly with the loss and fragmentation of sagebrush ecosystems across most of its geographical range. The species has been considered for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act multiple times, and was most recently ruled to not warrant protection as of September 2015. Nevertheless, the species faces threats from increasing wildfire frequency and changing climate, which are identified&nbsp;frequently as two environmental drivers contributing to declines of sage-grouse populations. To help inform a threat assessment within the Great Basin for listing sage-grouse in 2015 under the ESA, we conducted an extensive analysis of wildfire and climatic effects on sage-grouse population growth derived from 30 years of lek-count data collected across the hydrographic Great Basin of Western North America. Annual (1984\u20132013) patterns of wildfire were derived from an extensive dataset of remotely sensed 30-meter imagery and precipitation derived from locally downscaled spatially explicit data. In the sagebrush ecosystem, underlying soil conditions also contribute strongly to variation in resilience to disturbance and resistance to plant community changes (R&amp;R). Thus, we developed predictions from models of post-wildfire recovery and chronic effects of wildfire based on three spatially explicit R&amp;R classes derived from soil moisture and temperature regimes. We found evidence of an interaction between the effects of wildfire (chronically affected burned area within 5 kilometers of a lek) and climatic conditions (spring through fall precipitation) after accounting for a consistent density-dependent effect. Specifically, burned areas near leks nullifies population growth that normally follows years with relatively high precipitation. In models, this effect results in long-term population declines for sage-grouse despite cyclic periods of high precipitation. Based on 30-year projections of burn and recovery rates, our population model predicted steady and substantial long-term declines in population size across the Great Basin. Further, example management scenarios that may help offset adverse wildfire effects are provided by models of varying levels of fire suppression and post-wildfire restoration that focus on areas especially important to sage-grouse populations. These models illustrate how sage-grouse population persistence likely will be compromised as sagebrush ecosystems and sage-grouse habitat are degraded by wildfire, especially in a warmer and drier climate, and by invasion of annual grasses that can increase wildfire frequency and size in the Great Basin."

                "body": "Expanding human enterprise across remote environments impacts many wildlife species, including sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>), an indicator species whose decline is at the center of national conservation strategies and land use policies. Anthropogenic resources provide subsidies for generalist predators, potentially leading to cascading effects on sensitive prey species at lower trophic levels. In semi-arid western ecosystems, common ravens (<em>Corvus corax</em>) are expanding in distribution and abundance, and may be negatively affecting sage-grouse reproductive success at broad spatial scales. Ravens are a common predator of sage-grouse nests, and potentially prey on chicks as well. This research aimed to address the growing demand for information about potential interactions between subsidized predators (i.e. ravens) and species they prey upon. More specifically, our objectives were to disentangle natural and anthropogenic influences on raven occurrence at a landscape scale, and provide spatially explicit models and scientific products to help inform decisions regarding the management of ravens and conservation of sage-grouse. Using Bayesian hierarchical occupancy models, we mapped the broad-scale occurrence of common ravens as a function of natural and anthropogenic landscape covariates using more than 15,000 point count surveys performed during 2007\u20132016 within the Great Basin region, USA. In addition, we provide spatially explicit model-predicted surfaces that integrate anthropogenic and natural effects on raven occurrence with underlying information about breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach meets several objectives with respect to the conservation and management of sage-grouse and ravens. First, we established landscape-level patterns of predicted raven occurrence across the Great Basin region. Second, we determined associations between anthropogenic and natural features, and the broad-scale occurrence of ravens. Third, we identified regions where A) high predicted raven occurrence overlapped with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas, and B) areas where raven occurrence was strongly influenced by anthropogenic (vs. natural) variables overlapping with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach can guide management decisions where subsidized predators overlap sensitive prey habitats. For example, management applications could focus on reducing raven access to anthropogenic subsidies in areas where elevated raven occurrence coincides with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas and appears to be largely driven by anthropogenic factors, while prioritizing habitat improvements for sage-grouse elsewhere. Our approach is applicable to other species where widespread survey data are available.<br>\n<br>\nThese data support the following publication:<br>\nO\u2019Neil, S.T., Coates, P.S., Brussee, B.E., Jackson, P.J., Howe, K.B., Moser, A.M., Foster, L.J., and Delehanty, D.J. 2018, Broad-scale occurrence of a subsidized avian predator: reducing impacts of ravens on sage-grouse and other sensitive prey. <em>Journal of Applied Ecology&nbsp;</em>"

For Greater sage-grouse in southwest Wyoming, we projected oil and gas development footprints and climate-induced vegetation changes fifty years into the future. Using a time-series of planned oil and gas development and predicted climate-induced changes in vegetation, we re-calculated habitat selection maps to dynamically modify future habitat quantity, quality, and configuration. We simulated long-term sage-grouse responses to habitat change by allowing individuals to adjust to shifts in habitat availability and quality. The use of spatially explicit individual-based modeling offered an important means of evaluating delayed indirect impacts of landscape change on wildlife population outcomes.

The research was carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center and Boise State University researchers, in partnership with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Idaho Army National Guard. Most of the research for the project focused on the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (hereafter the NCA) in southern Idaho. Sagebrush shrublands in the NCA, and throughout much of the Great Basin and Snake River Plain, are highly influenced by non-native plants that alter successional trajectories, suppress native species, and promote frequent wildfire. Fine-fuel loadings created by nonnative annual grasses and forbs can be highly variable through space and time, which can increase uncertainty when predicting fire risk and behavior. The overarching goal of the research project was to explore and develop different approaches to better quantify and predict these dynamic fuel loadings, as well as the effects of fuels manipulations in sagebrush habitats. The purpose of this database is to provide a tool that allows ready access to fuel loading data across a range of conditions, from relatively intact sagebrush-bunchgrass communities to degraded communities dominated by nonnative annual grasses and forbs. The Fuels Guide and Database (FGD) is a tool designed to assist land managers in estimating fuel loads within a specific stand of vegetation, under conditions ranging from sagebrush-dominated to nonnative, annual grass/forb-dominated communities. Users can query the database based on vegetation cover, vegetation height, and specific environmental variables (for example elevation, precipitation, temperature, soil surface texture, and ecological site) and return fuel loading data that match the query parameters. The FGD also allows users to view photos by point or plot and to individually exclude certain points or plots to help identify areas that best match the current conditions. Final results can be exported to Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or summarized in Microsoft Word reports that can be used to improve estimates of fuel loadings in the field. Fuels data were collected on the NCA, and therefore extrapolation of queried results should also only be applied to the NCA and similar regional environments. However, there is potential for additional cover data, vegetation height data, and fuels data to be added to the FGD. If you are interested in contributing data to the FGD please contact the USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center (fresc_outreach@usgs.gov). With additional input from other users, the Fuels Guide and Database has the potential to be a powerful tool throughout the sagebrush shrublands to assist land managers in quickly estimating fuel loadings.<br>\n<br>\nShinneman, D.J., Pilliod, D.S., Arkle, R.S., and Glenn, N.F., 2015, Quantifying and predicting fuels and the effects of reduction treatments along successional and invasion gradients in sagebrush habitats: Joint Fire Science Program, p. 1-44.<br>\n<br>\nPlease contact fresc_outreach@usgs.gov if you have difficulty downloading the data files.

Two summit sites were established in 2003 on Dancing Lady and Bison Mountain, east of the continental divide. Two additional summit sites were established in 2004 on Pitamakin and Mt. Seward, also east of the continental divide. This multi-summit approach to monitoring alpine plant species follows the protocols of the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments (GLORIA) that were initiated by the University of Vienna in 2000 and which have been refined and revised since then. GLORIA summit sites now exist throughout the world. Current protocols are available at: https://gloria.ac.at/downloads/manual. Plant surveys took place every five years during peak alpine plant growing season in late July and August on all aspects of the summits using a combination of area surveys and meter plots. Temperature loggers were buried 10 cm in the substrate on each summit aspect and the highest point of the summit area. The loggers recorded temperature at hourly intervals and were replaced every 3-5 years. Nearly continuous temperatures for some loggers were obtained from 2003 through 2018. To better track interannual variability, another band of plots was established below the summit plots in 2010 for Dancing Lady and 2011 for Pitamakin. These were surveyed every year until 2014. A total of 189 species were recorded for the four summit sites. Preliminary results indicated species turnover rates of 0-36% at the five year interval, and 6-55% at the ten year interval. Annual turnover rates for the lower bands on Dancing Lady and Pitamakin were 2-18%. The NE aspects were most species rich and S aspects had the greatest turnover rates. Little difference was evident as a function of elevation. Additional surveys are planned for the summer of 2019."

People have been compiling non-native and invasive species lists ever since these species started causing harm, yet national non-native species lists are neither universal, nor common. Non-native species lists serve diverse purposes: watch lists for preventing invasions, inventory and monitoring lists for research and modeling, regulatory lists for species control, and nonregulatory lists for raising awareness. This diversity of purpose and the lists\u2019 variation in geographic scope make compiling comprehensive lists of established (or naturalized) species for large regions difficult. However, listing what species are non-native in an area helps in calculating Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), which are&nbsp;measurements required&nbsp;for studying, reporting, and managing environmental problems (McGeoch and Squires, 2015,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://invasionevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MonitoringBiologicalInvasions.TechnicalReport.pdf\">http://invasionevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MonitoringBiologicalInvasions.TechnicalReport.pdf</a>). Measuring invasive species EBVs is needed to mount an effective response to established non-native species. The intent, though not a guarantee, is to update the list in an ongoing way as non-native species become established in, or are eliminated from, the United States. The list has been used to annotate non-native species occurrence records in the U.S. Geological Survey all-taxa mapping application, Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON, <a href=\"https://bison.usgs.gov\">https://bison.usgs.gov</a>).<br>\nAs of 2018-07-26, 1,166 authoritative sources were reviewed to compile the first comprehensive non-native species list for three large regions of the United States: Alaska, Hawaii, and the conterminous United States (lower 48 States), and the list contains 11,344 unique names: 598 taxa for Alaska, 5,848 taxa for Hawaii, and 6,675 taxa for the conterminous United States.&nbsp;"

                "body": "Defining the pre-European range of vegetation communities can enhance our understanding of the role soil, hydrology, and climate had on climax plant communities within southwest Louisiana. Coastal prairie grasslands were in a perpetual state of succession due to two primary disturbances; grazing, primarily by bison and other ungulates, and fires ignited by lightning and Native Americans. Along its borders, prairie vegetation blended into adjacent plant communities forming biologically diverse ecotones that may have fluctuated between a prairie, marsh, or forest dominated community as a result of variable conditions including climate cycles, disturbance and soil characteristics. Since European settlement, this landscape has undergone dramatic change with less than 1% of intact coastal prairie remaining. Conservation entities across the Western Gulf Coastal Plain are taking a collaborative, strategic, landscape scale approach to to conservation to enhance biotic and abiotic communities including pollinators.&nbsp;<br>\nThis effort encourages communication and implementation of restoration and habitat enhancement actions within water sheds. We have produced a spatial dataset which considers landscape position and soil type, based on Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) data, to predict appropriate vegetation associations for plantings across southwest Louisiana based on expert elicitation, and historic references. Methods to produce this product begin with soil boundaries and identification information using Map Unit Keys (MUKEY) which were gathered from SSURGO data (Soil Survey Staff, NRCS 2017). Each mukey number was reviewed on the SOIL WEB to obtain information about components. Components include the proportion and general geomorphic features associated with soil series. Natural vegetation associations were examined and documented for each soil series individually using multiple references, including USDA Soil Series descriptions, expert elicitation, and historical spatial references. Professional reference maps contributed to this spatial dataset and include an 1863 work by Henry L. Abbot and numerous General Land Office surveyor maps and surveyor descriptions from the early 1800s drawn at the scale of a township. General vegetation categories associated with Soil Types (Mukey) were derived from reviewing the vegetation associations of the dominant components, or soil series. These general categories include: anthropogenic, prairie, transition, forest, marsh, swamp, uncertain, and water. Anthropogenic categories were generally due to significant dredging, or other industrial activities. Transitional areas included savannas and areas which may have significantly changed from prairie to forest dominated communities due to rainfall and/or fire frequency and intensity. Forest and swamp includes a range of forest types from which the distinction between these two categories primarily depend upon relative elevation and hydrology. There were a few soil series in which we are uncertain of their pre-settlement vegetation. These areas are anomalies on the landscape and include salt domes and old, disjunct river meanders which are largely comprised of Pleistocene soils and were most likely marais, yet currently much of it is heavily forested as bottomlands, and we are therefore uncertain if this result is solely due to absence of fire. Attribute data include MUKEYs within the parishes which are included in the Louisiana portion of the Gulf Coastal Plain Ecoregion. Information in the table includes symbols, common names, and components which were compiled from SSURGO dataset and Soil Web online resources (Soil Survey Staff, NRCS, accessed 2/2017).

Unraveling the relationships between climate and population dynamics, and projecting them across time, advances ecological understanding that informs and steers sustainable conservation for species. Using pronghorn (<em>Antilocapra americana</em>) as an ecological model, we used a Bayesian approach to analyze long-term population, precipitation, and temperature data from 18 populations in the southwestern United States. We determined which long-term (12 and 24 months) or short-term (gestation trimester and lactation period) climatic conditions best predicted annual rate of population growth (\u03bb). We used these predictions to project population trends through 2090. Projections incorporated downscaled climatic data matched to pronghorn range for each population, given a high and a lower atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;concentration scenario. Since the 1990s, 15 of the pronghorn populations declined in abundance. Sixteen populations demonstrated a significant relationship between precipitation and \u03bb, and in 13 of these, temperature was also significant. Precipitation predictors of \u03bb were highly seasonal, with lactation being the most important period, followed by early and late gestation. The influence of temperature on \u03bb was less seasonal than precipitation, and lacked a clear temporal pattern. The climatic projections indicated that all of these pronghorn populations would experience increased temperatures, while the direction and magnitude of precipitation had high population-specific variation. Models predicted that nine populations would be extirpated or approaching extirpation by 2090. Results were consistent across both atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;concentration scenarios, indicating robustness of trends irrespective of climatic severity. In the southwestern United States, the climate underpinning pronghorn populations is shifting, making conditions increasingly inhospitable to pronghorn persistence. This realization informs and steers conservation and management decisions for pronghorn in North America, while exemplifying how similar research can aid ungulates inhabiting arid regions and confronting similar circumstances elsewhere."

We collected deer scat piles from both sides of these crossings in spring between March and June of 2015, and again in fall throughout October 2015. Collected pellets were extracted and amplified using protocols and loci developed by Bohonak and Mitelberg (2014). DNA fingerprinting results were used to investigate mule deer movement in the region directly by identifying individuals which had been captured multiple times throughout the study period. We also assessed movement indirectly through pedigree reconstruction and population structure analyses. The shapefile below contains 126 deer scat piles and the genotypes obtained at 15 microsatellite markers and one sex specific genetic marker. These represented 71 unique individual genotypes (45 females, 26 males) with 9 recapture events and 46 resampling events (defined as scat piles collected at the same location within one week of each other and matching the same unique genotype).\n<br> \n<br> These data support the following publicaton;\n<br> \n<br> Mitelberg, A. &amp; Vandergast, A.G.

                "body": "Nutritional ecology forms the interface between environmental variability and large herbivore behaviour, life history characteristics, and population dynamics. Forage conditions in arid and semi-arid regions are driven by unpredictable spatial and temporal patterns in rainfall. Diet selection by herbivores should be directed towards overcoming the most pressing nutritional limitation (i.e. energy, protein [nitrogen, N], moisture) within the constraints imposed by temporal and spatial variability in forage conditions. We investigated the influence of precipitation-induced shifts in forage nutritional quality and subsequent large herbivore responses across widely varying precipitation conditions in an arid environment. Specifically, we assessed seasonal changes in diet breadth and forage selection of adult female desert bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis mexicana in relation to potential nutritional limitations in forage N, moisture and energy content (as proxied by dry matter digestibility, DMD). Succulents were consistently high in moisture but low in N and grasses were low in N and moisture until the wet period. Nitrogen and moisture content of shrubs and forbs varied among seasons and climatic periods, whereas trees had consistently high N and moderate moisture levels. Shrubs, trees and succulents composed most of the seasonal sheep diets but had little variation in DMD. Across all seasons during drought and during summer with average precipitation, forages selected by sheep were higher in N and moisture than that of available forage. Differences in DMD between sheep diets and available forage were minor. Diet breadth was lowest during drought and increased with precipitation, reflecting a reliance on few key forage species during drought. Overall, forage selection was more strongly associated with N and moisture content than energy content. Our study demonstrates that unlike north-temperate ungulates which are generally reported to be energy-limited, N and moisture may be more nutritionally limiting for desert ungulates than digestible energy."

                "body": "Climate often drives ungulate population dynamics, and as climates change, some areas may become unsuitable for species persistence. Unraveling the relationships between climate and population dynamics, and projecting them across time, advances ecological understanding that informs and steers sustainable conservation for species. Using pronghorn (<em>Antilocapra americana</em>) as an ecological model, we used a Bayesian approach to analyze long-term population, precipitation, and temperature data from 18 populations in the southwestern United States. We determined which long-term (12 and 24 months) or short-term (gestation trimester and lactation period) climatic conditions best predicted annual rate of population growth (\u03bb). We used these predictions to project population trends through 2090. Projections incorporated downscaled climatic data matched to pronghorn range for each population, given a high and a lower atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;concentration scenario. Since the 1990s, 15 of the pronghorn populations declined in abundance. Sixteen populations demonstrated a significant relationship between precipitation and \u03bb, and in 13 of these, temperature was also significant. Precipitation predictors of \u03bb were highly seasonal, with lactation being the most important period, followed by early and late gestation. The influence of temperature on \u03bb was less seasonal than precipitation, and lacked a clear temporal pattern. The climatic projections indicated that all of these pronghorn populations would experience increased temperatures, while the direction and magnitude of precipitation had high population-specific variation. Models predicted that nine populations would be extirpated or approaching extirpation by 2090. Results were consistent across both atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;concentration scenarios, indicating robustness of trends irrespective of climatic severity. In the southwestern United States, the climate underpinning pronghorn populations is shifting, making conditions increasingly inhospitable to pronghorn persistence. This realization informs and steers conservation and management decisions for pronghorn in North America, while exemplifying how similar research can aid ungulates inhabiting arid regions and confronting similar circumstances elsewhere."

                "body": "The Fuels Guide and Database for Big Sagebrush Ecological Sites was developed as part of the Joint Fire Sciences Program project \"Quantifying and predicting fuels and the effects of reduction treatments along successional and invasion gradients in sagebrush habitats\" (Shinneman and others, 2015). The research was carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center and Boise State University researchers, in partnership with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Idaho Army National Guard. Most of the research for the project focused on the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (hereafter the NCA) in southern Idaho. Sagebrush shrublands in the NCA, and throughout much of the Great Basin and Snake River Plain, are highly influenced by non-native plants that alter successional trajectories, suppress native species, and promote frequent wildfire. Fine-fuel loadings created by nonnative annual grasses and forbs can be highly variable through space and time, which can increase uncertainty when predicting fire risk and behavior. The overarching goal of the research project was to explore and develop different approaches to better quantify and predict these dynamic fuel loadings, as well as the effects of fuels manipulations in sagebrush habitats. The purpose of this database is to provide a tool that allows ready access to fuel loading data across a range of conditions, from relatively intact sagebrush-bunchgrass communities to degraded communities dominated by nonnative annual grasses and forbs. The Fuels Guide and Database (FGD) is a tool designed to assist land managers in estimating fuel loads within a specific stand of vegetation, under conditions ranging from sagebrush-dominated to nonnative, annual grass/forb-dominated communities. Users can query the database based on vegetation cover, vegetation height, and specific environmental variables (for example elevation, precipitation, temperature, soil surface texture, and ecological site) and return fuel loading data that match the query parameters. The FGD also allows users to view photos by point or plot and to individually exclude certain points or plots to help identify areas that best match the current conditions. Final results can be exported to Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or summarized in Microsoft Word reports that can be used to improve estimates of fuel loadings in the field. Fuels data were collected on the NCA, and therefore extrapolation of queried results should also only be applied to the NCA and similar regional environments. However, there is potential for additional cover data, vegetation height data, and fuels data to be added to the FGD. If you are interested in contributing data to the FGD please contact the USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center (fresc_outreach@usgs.gov). With additional input from other users, the Fuels Guide and Database has the potential to be a powerful tool throughout the sagebrush shrublands to assist land managers in quickly estimating fuel loadings.<br>\n<br>\nShinneman, D.J., Pilliod, D.S., Arkle, R.S., and Glenn, N.F., 2015, Quantifying and predicting fuels and the effects of reduction treatments along successional and invasion gradients in sagebrush habitats: Joint Fire Science Program, p. 1-44.<br>\n<br>\nPlease contact fresc_outreach@usgs.gov if you have difficulty downloading the data files.

Updating management tools for greater sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>, hereafter referred to as \u201csage-grouse\u201d) populations, which are indicators for the large-scale health of sagebrush (<em>Artemisia spp.</em>) ecosystems in the Great Basin of North America, provide a timely example for this tenet. Recently developed spatially-explicit habitat maps derived from empirical data played a key role in the conservation of this species facing listing under the Endangered Species Act. Herein, this report provides an updated process for mapping relative habitat suitability and management categories for sage-grouse in Nevada and northeastern California (Coates and others, 2014, 2016). These updates included: 1) adding radio-and GPS telemetry locations from sage-grouse monitored at multiple sites during 2014 to the original location dataset beginning in 1998; 2) integrating output from high resolution maps (1 \u2013 2 m 2) of sagebrush and pinyon-juniper cover as covariates in resource selection models; 3) explicit modeling of relative habitat suitability during three seasons (breeding, brood-rearing, over-wintering) critical to sage-grouse life history; 4) accounting for differences in habitat availability between more mesic sagebrush steppe communities in the northern part of the study area and drier Great Basin sagebrush in more southerly regions by categorizing continuous region-wide surfaces of habitat suitability index (HSI) with independent locations falling within two hydrological flood zones; 5) integrating the three seasonal maps into a composite map of annual relative habitat suitability; 6) deriving updated land management categories based on previously determined cut-points for intersections of habitat suitability and an updated index of sage-grouse abundance and space-use (AUI), and 7) masking urban footprints and major roadways out of the final map products. Seasonal habitat maps were generated based on model-averaged resource selection functions derived for 10 project areas (813 grouse, 14,085 locations) during the breeding season, 10 during the brood-rearing season (591, 11,743), and 7 during the winter season (288, 4,862). RSF surfaces were transformed to HSIs and averaged in a GIS framework for each pixel for each season. Validation analyses of categorized HSI surfaces using a suite of independent datasets resulted in an agreement of 93\u201397 percent for habitat versus non-habitat on an annual basis. Breeding and brood rearing maps validated similarly well at 94-97 percent, while winter maps validated slightly less accurately at 87-93 percent. We provide an updated example of how space use models can be integrated with habitat models to help inform conservation planning. Using data, we combined probabilistic breeding density with a non-linear probability of occurrence relative to distance to nearest lek (traditional breeding ground) using count data to calculate the AUI. The AUI was then classified into two categories of use (high and low-to-no) and intersected with the HSI categories to create potential management prioritization scenarios based on information about sage-grouse occupancy coupled with habitat suitability. The spatially explicit data herein provide updated measures (in comparison to Coates et al. 2014, 2016) of areal extent (i.e., acres) classified within the four habitat suitability and four management categories. Importantly, seasonal and annual maps represent habitat for all age and sex classes of sage-grouse (that is; sample sizes of marked grouse were insufficient to only construct models for reproductive females). This revised sage-grouse habitat mapping product helps improve adaptive application of conservation planning tools based on intersections of spatially-explicit habitat suitability, abundance, and space use indices.<br>\n<br>\nREFERENCES: Coates, P.S., Casazza, M.L., Brussee, B.E., Ricca, M.A., Gustafson, K.B., Overton, C.T., Sanchez-Chopitea, E., Kroger, T., Mauch, K., Niell, L., Howe, K., Gardner, S., Espinosa, S., and Delehanty, D.J. 2014, Spatially explicit modeling of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat in Nevada and northeastern California\u2014A decision-support tool for management: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2014-1163, 83 p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20141163.

To inform greater sage-grouse conservation planning, the researchers developed greater sage-grouse habitat management categories based on habitat selection indices (HSI) and greater sage-grouse abundance and space-use index (AUI).

Encroachment of these trees into sagebrush ecosystems of the Great Basin can present a threat to populations of greater sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>). These data provide land managers and other interested parties with a high-resolution representation of conifers within the geographic range of the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment of greater sage-grouse that can be used for a variety of management and research applications.<br>\n<br>\nWe mapped conifer trees at 1 x 1 meter resolution across the extent of all Nevada Department of Wildlife Bi-State Sage-grouse Population Management Units plus a 10 km buffer. Using 2010 and 2013 National Agriculture Imagery Program digital orthophoto quads (DOQQs) as our reference imagery, we applied object-based image analysis with Feature Analyst software (Overwatch, 2013) to classify conifer features across our study extent. This method relies on machine learning algorithms that extract features from imagery based on their spectral and spatial signatures. Conifers in 702 DOQQs were classified and outputs were then tested for errors of omission and commission using stratified random sampling. Results of the random sampling were used to populate a confusion matrix and calculate the overall map accuracy of 86.96 percent. However, these data have yet to undergo final modifications to correct for hard seamline transitions or serious errors of omission/commission.<br>\n<br>\nWe provide 4 sets of products for this mapping process across the entire mapping extent: (1) a shapefile representing accuracy results linked to our mapping subunits; (2) binary rasters representing conifer presence or absence at a 1 x 1 meter resolution; (3) a 30 x 30 meter resolution raster representing percentage of conifer canopy cover within each cell from 0 to 100; and (4) 1 x 1 meter resolution canopy cover classification rasters derived from a 50 meter radius moving window analysis. The latter two products can be reclassified into user-specified bins to meet different management or study objectives, which include approximations for phases of encroachment. These products complement, and in some cases improve upon, existing conifer maps in the western United States, and will help facilitate sage-grouse habitat management and sagebrush ecosystem restoration.<br>\n<br>\nReferences: Overwatch, 2013, Feature Analyst Version 5.1.2.0 for ArcGIS: Overwatch Systems Ltd., Sterling, VA."

                "body": "Greater sage-grouse ( \n<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>; hereinafter, sage-grouse) are a sagebrush obligate species that has declined concomitantly with the loss and fragmentation of sagebrush ecosystems across most of its geographical range. The species has been considered for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act multiple times, and was most recently ruled to not warrant protection as of September 2015. Nevertheless, the species faces threats from increasing wildfire frequency and changing climate, which are identified&nbsp;frequently as two environmental drivers contributing to declines of sage-grouse populations. To help inform a threat assessment within the Great Basin for listing sage-grouse in 2015 under the ESA, we conducted an extensive analysis of wildfire and climatic effects on sage-grouse population growth derived from 30 years of lek-count data collected across the hydrographic Great Basin of Western North America. Annual (1984\u20132013) patterns of wildfire were derived from an extensive dataset of remotely sensed 30-meter imagery and precipitation derived from locally downscaled spatially explicit data. In the sagebrush ecosystem, underlying soil conditions also contribute strongly to variation in resilience to disturbance and resistance to plant community changes (R&amp;R). Thus, we developed predictions from models of post-wildfire recovery and chronic effects of wildfire based on three spatially explicit R&amp;R classes derived from soil moisture and temperature regimes. We found evidence of an interaction between the effects of wildfire (chronically affected burned area within 5 kilometers of a lek) and climatic conditions (spring through fall precipitation) after accounting for a consistent density-dependent effect. Specifically, burned areas near leks nullifies population growth that normally follows years with relatively high precipitation. In models, this effect results in long-term population declines for sage-grouse despite cyclic periods of high precipitation. Based on 30-year projections of burn and recovery rates, our population model predicted steady and substantial long-term declines in population size across the Great Basin. Further, example management scenarios that may help offset adverse wildfire effects are provided by models of varying levels of fire suppression and post-wildfire restoration that focus on areas especially important to sage-grouse populations. These models illustrate how sage-grouse population persistence likely will be compromised as sagebrush ecosystems and sage-grouse habitat are degraded by wildfire, especially in a warmer and drier climate, and by invasion of annual grasses that can increase wildfire frequency and size in the Great Basin."

These data provide land managers and other interested parties with a high-resolution representation of conifers across the range of sage-grouse habitat in Nevada and northeastern California that can be used for a variety of management and research applications.<br>\n<br>\nWe mapped conifer trees at 1 x 1 meter resolution across the extent of all Nevada Department of Wildlife Sage-grouse Population Management Units plus a 10 km buffer. Using 2010 and 2013 National Agriculture Imagery Program digital orthophoto quads (DOQQs) as our reference imagery, we applied object-based image analysis with Feature Analyst software (Overwatch, 2013) to classify conifer features across our study extent. This method relies on machine learning algorithms that extract features from imagery based on their spectral and spatial signatures. Conifers in 6230 DOQQs were classified and outputs were then tested for errors of omission and commission using stratified random sampling. Results of the random sampling were used to populate a confusion matrix and calculate the overall map accuracy of 84.3 percent.<br>\n<br>\nWe provide 4 sets of products for this mapping process across the entire mapping extent: (1) a shapefile representing accuracy results linked to our mapping subunits; (2) binary rasters representing conifer presence or absence at a 1 x 1 meter resolution; (3) a 30 x 30 meter resolution raster representing percentage of conifer canopy cover within each cell from 0 to 100; and (4) 1 x 1 meter resolution canopy cover classification rasters derived from a 50 meter radius moving window analysis. The latter two products can be reclassified into user-specified bins to meet different management or study objectives, which include approximations for phases of encroachment. These products complement, and in some cases improve upon, existing conifer maps in the western United States, and will help facilitate sage-grouse habitat management and sagebrush ecosystem restoration.<br>\n<br>\nThese data support the following publication: Coates, P.S., Gustafson, K.B., Roth, C.L., Chenaille, M.P., Ricca, M.A., Mauch, Kimberly, Sanchez-Chopitea, Erika, Kroger, T.J., Perry, W.M., and Casazza, M.L., 2017, Using object-based image analysis to conduct high-resolution conifer extraction at regional spatial scales: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2017-1093, 40 p.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20171093\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20171093</a>.<br>\n<br>\nReferences: ESRI, 2013, ArcGIS Desktop: Release 10.2: Environmental Systems Research Institute.

The mineral-resources tracts are geographic areas that were assessed by the USGS and were determined to be geologically favorable for a deposit type of interest to a depth of 1 kilometer. Qualitative assessment methods outlined by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) were used to develop tract boundaries and to assign a level of mineral-resource potential and certainty to each tract. The general process included (1) identifying possible mineral deposit types for locatable commodities specified by BLM for each focal area, (2) outlining those areas that potentially contained mineral deposits based on geology, mineral occurrences, geophysics, soil and stream-sediment geochemistry, alteration mineral assemblages inferred from satellite imagery, BLM claims and permit data, mineral-exploration activity, and existing mineral-resource assessment data, and (3) evaluating the level of mineral-resource potential and level of certainty associated with the outlined areas using BLM assessment categories. A full description of the assessment is provided in the accompanying report (Day and others, 2016).<br>\n<br>\nSFAs, identified by agencies of the DOI, are high-quality sagebrush habitat areas supporting high densities of breeding greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). SFAs are within priority habitat areas or areas where land-use measures are intended to minimize or avoid habitat disturbance. Seven SFAs are within the USGS Sagebrush Mineral-Resource Assessment Project study area. They include the Bear River Watershed, North-Central Idaho, North-Central Montana, Southeastern Oregon and North-Central Nevada, Sheldon-Hart Mountain National Wildlife Refuge Complex, Southern Idaho and Northern Nevada, and Southwestern and South-Central Wyoming SFAs, as well as additional areas in Nevada (termed the \u201cNevada additions\u201d) proposed by the State of Nevada. Landscape-scale conservation efforts by the BLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), State agencies, private land owners, and other partners are striving to conserve the breeding sagebrush habitat for the greater sage-grouse across these areas.<br>\n<br>\nAccompanying report (Chapter A): Day, W.C., Hammarstrom, J.M., Zientek, M.L., and Frost, T.P., eds., 2016, Overview with methods and procedures of the U.S. Geological Survey mineral-resource assessment of the Sagebrush Focal Areas of Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2016\u20135089, 211 p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20165089.<br>\n<br>\nTo quickly view the data, please access the ScienceBase interactive map viewer via the \"Map\" link in the upper-right corner of this page.

                "body": "Expanding human enterprise across remote environments impacts many wildlife species, including sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>), an indicator species whose decline is at the center of national conservation strategies and land use policies. Anthropogenic resources provide subsidies for generalist predators, potentially leading to cascading effects on sensitive prey species at lower trophic levels. In semi-arid western ecosystems, common ravens (<em>Corvus corax</em>) are expanding in distribution and abundance, and may be negatively affecting sage-grouse reproductive success at broad spatial scales. Ravens are a common predator of sage-grouse nests, and potentially prey on chicks as well. This research aimed to address the growing demand for information about potential interactions between subsidized predators (i.e. ravens) and species they prey upon. More specifically, our objectives were to disentangle natural and anthropogenic influences on raven occurrence at a landscape scale, and provide spatially explicit models and scientific products to help inform decisions regarding the management of ravens and conservation of sage-grouse. Using Bayesian hierarchical occupancy models, we mapped the broad-scale occurrence of common ravens as a function of natural and anthropogenic landscape covariates using more than 15,000 point count surveys performed during 2007\u20132016 within the Great Basin region, USA. In addition, we provide spatially explicit model-predicted surfaces that integrate anthropogenic and natural effects on raven occurrence with underlying information about breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach meets several objectives with respect to the conservation and management of sage-grouse and ravens. First, we established landscape-level patterns of predicted raven occurrence across the Great Basin region. Second, we determined associations between anthropogenic and natural features, and the broad-scale occurrence of ravens. Third, we identified regions where A) high predicted raven occurrence overlapped with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas, and B) areas where raven occurrence was strongly influenced by anthropogenic (vs. natural) variables overlapping with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach can guide management decisions where subsidized predators overlap sensitive prey habitats. For example, management applications could focus on reducing raven access to anthropogenic subsidies in areas where elevated raven occurrence coincides with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas and appears to be largely driven by anthropogenic factors, while prioritizing habitat improvements for sage-grouse elsewhere. Our approach is applicable to other species where widespread survey data are available.<br>\n<br>\nThese data support the following publication:<br>\nO\u2019Neil, S.T., Coates, P.S., Brussee, B.E., Jackson, P.J., Howe, K.B., Moser, A.M., Foster, L.J., and Delehanty, D.J. 2018, Broad-scale occurrence of a subsidized avian predator: reducing impacts of ravens on sage-grouse and other sensitive prey. <em>Journal of Applied Ecology&nbsp;</em>"

Greater sage-grouse population change (percent change) in a high oil and gas development, low population estimate scenario, and with no effects of climate change (2006-2062)<br>\n<br>\nThe oil and gas development scenario were based on an energy footprint model that simulates well, pad, and road patterns for oil and gas recovery options that vary in well types (vertical and directional) and number of wells per pad and use simulation results to quantify physical and wildlife-habitat impacts. I applied the model to assess tradeoffs among 10 conventional and directional-drilling scenarios in a natural gas field in southwestern Wyoming (see Garman 2017).<br>\n<br>\nThe effects climate change on sagebrush were developed using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM, version 4) climate model and representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario (emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century). The projected climate scenario was used to estimate the change in percent cover of sagebrush (see Homer et al. 2015).<br>\n<br>\nThe percent changes in sage-grouse population sizes represented in these data are modeled using an individual-based population model that simulates dynamics of populations by tracking movements of individuals in dynamically changing landscapes, as well as the fates of individuals as influenced by spatially heterogeneous demography.<br>\n<br>\nWe developed a case study to assess how spatially explicit individual based modeling could be used to evaluate future population outcomes of gradual landscape change from multiple stressors. For Greater sage-grouse in southwest Wyoming, we projected oil and gas development footprints and climate-induced vegetation changes fifty years into the future. Using a time-series of planned oil and gas development and predicted climate-induced changes in vegetation, we re-calculated habitat selection maps to dynamically modify future habitat quantity, quality, and configuration. We simulated long-term sage-grouse responses to habitat change by allowing individuals to adjust to shifts in habitat availability and quality. The use of spatially explicit individual-based modeling offered an important means of evaluating delayed indirect impacts of landscape change on wildlife population outcomes.

                "body": "Climate often drives ungulate population dynamics, and as climates change, some areas may become unsuitable for species persistence. Unraveling the relationships between climate and population dynamics, and projecting them across time, advances ecological understanding that informs and steers sustainable conservation for species. Using pronghorn (<em>Antilocapra americana</em>) as an ecological model, we used a Bayesian approach to analyze long-term population, precipitation, and temperature data from 18 populations in the southwestern United States. We determined which long-term (12 and 24 months) or short-term (gestation trimester and lactation period) climatic conditions best predicted annual rate of population growth (\u03bb). We used these predictions to project population trends through 2090. Projections incorporated downscaled climatic data matched to pronghorn range for each population, given a high and a lower atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;concentration scenario. Since the 1990s, 15 of the pronghorn populations declined in abundance. Sixteen populations demonstrated a significant relationship between precipitation and \u03bb, and in 13 of these, temperature was also significant. Precipitation predictors of \u03bb were highly seasonal, with lactation being the most important period, followed by early and late gestation. The influence of temperature on \u03bb was less seasonal than precipitation, and lacked a clear temporal pattern. The climatic projections indicated that all of these pronghorn populations would experience increased temperatures, while the direction and magnitude of precipitation had high population-specific variation. Models predicted that nine populations would be extirpated or approaching extirpation by 2090. Results were consistent across both atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;concentration scenarios, indicating robustness of trends irrespective of climatic severity. In the southwestern United States, the climate underpinning pronghorn populations is shifting, making conditions increasingly inhospitable to pronghorn persistence. This realization informs and steers conservation and management decisions for pronghorn in North America, while exemplifying how similar research can aid ungulates inhabiting arid regions and confronting similar circumstances elsewhere."

We collected deer scat piles from both sides of these crossings in spring between March and June of 2015, and again in fall throughout October 2015. Collected pellets were extracted and amplified using protocols and loci developed by Bohonak and Mitelberg (2014). DNA fingerprinting results were used to investigate mule deer movement in the region directly by identifying individuals which had been captured multiple times throughout the study period. We also assessed movement indirectly through pedigree reconstruction and population structure analyses. The shapefile below contains 126 deer scat piles and the genotypes obtained at 15 microsatellite markers and one sex specific genetic marker. These represented 71 unique individual genotypes (45 females, 26 males) with 9 recapture events and 46 resampling events (defined as scat piles collected at the same location within one week of each other and matching the same unique genotype).\n<br> \n<br> These data support the following publicaton;\n<br> \n<br> Mitelberg, A. &amp; Vandergast, A.G.

                "body": "The Fuels Guide and Database for Big Sagebrush Ecological Sites was developed as part of the Joint Fire Sciences Program project \"Quantifying and predicting fuels and the effects of reduction treatments along successional and invasion gradients in sagebrush habitats\" (Shinneman and others, 2015). The research was carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center and Boise State University researchers, in partnership with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Idaho Army National Guard. Most of the research for the project focused on the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (hereafter the NCA) in southern Idaho. Sagebrush shrublands in the NCA, and throughout much of the Great Basin and Snake River Plain, are highly influenced by non-native plants that alter successional trajectories, suppress native species, and promote frequent wildfire. Fine-fuel loadings created by nonnative annual grasses and forbs can be highly variable through space and time, which can increase uncertainty when predicting fire risk and behavior. The overarching goal of the research project was to explore and develop different approaches to better quantify and predict these dynamic fuel loadings, as well as the effects of fuels manipulations in sagebrush habitats. The purpose of this database is to provide a tool that allows ready access to fuel loading data across a range of conditions, from relatively intact sagebrush-bunchgrass communities to degraded communities dominated by nonnative annual grasses and forbs. The Fuels Guide and Database (FGD) is a tool designed to assist land managers in estimating fuel loads within a specific stand of vegetation, under conditions ranging from sagebrush-dominated to nonnative, annual grass/forb-dominated communities. Users can query the database based on vegetation cover, vegetation height, and specific environmental variables (for example elevation, precipitation, temperature, soil surface texture, and ecological site) and return fuel loading data that match the query parameters. The FGD also allows users to view photos by point or plot and to individually exclude certain points or plots to help identify areas that best match the current conditions. Final results can be exported to Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or summarized in Microsoft Word reports that can be used to improve estimates of fuel loadings in the field. Fuels data were collected on the NCA, and therefore extrapolation of queried results should also only be applied to the NCA and similar regional environments. However, there is potential for additional cover data, vegetation height data, and fuels data to be added to the FGD. If you are interested in contributing data to the FGD please contact the USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center (fresc_outreach@usgs.gov). With additional input from other users, the Fuels Guide and Database has the potential to be a powerful tool throughout the sagebrush shrublands to assist land managers in quickly estimating fuel loadings.<br>\n<br>\nShinneman, D.J., Pilliod, D.S., Arkle, R.S., and Glenn, N.F., 2015, Quantifying and predicting fuels and the effects of reduction treatments along successional and invasion gradients in sagebrush habitats: Joint Fire Science Program, p. 1-44.<br>\n<br>\nPlease contact fresc_outreach@usgs.gov if you have difficulty downloading the data files.

                "body": "Successful adaptive management hinges largely upon integrating new and improved sources of information as they become available. Updating management tools for greater sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>, hereafter referred to as \u201csage-grouse\u201d) populations, which are indicators for the large-scale health of sagebrush (<em>Artemisia spp.</em>) ecosystems in the Great Basin of North America, provide a timely example for this tenet. Recently developed spatially-explicit habitat maps derived from empirical data played a key role in the conservation of this species facing listing under the Endangered Species Act. Herein, this report provides an updated process for mapping relative habitat suitability and management categories for sage-grouse in Nevada and northeastern California (Coates and others, 2014, 2016). These updates included: 1) adding radio-and GPS telemetry locations from sage-grouse monitored at multiple sites during 2014 to the original location dataset beginning in 1998; 2) integrating output from high resolution maps (1 \u2013 2 m 2) of sagebrush and pinyon-juniper cover as covariates in resource selection models; 3) explicit modeling of relative habitat suitability during three seasons (breeding, brood-rearing, over-wintering) critical to sage-grouse life history; 4) accounting for differences in habitat availability between more mesic sagebrush steppe communities in the northern part of the study area and drier Great Basin sagebrush in more southerly regions by categorizing continuous region-wide surfaces of habitat suitability index (HSI) with independent locations falling within two hydrological flood zones; 5) integrating the three seasonal maps into a composite map of annual relative habitat suitability; 6) deriving updated land management categories based on previously determined cut-points for intersections of habitat suitability and an updated index of sage-grouse abundance and space-use (AUI), and 7) masking urban footprints and major roadways out of the final map products. Seasonal habitat maps were generated based on model-averaged resource selection functions derived for 10 project areas (813 grouse, 14,085 locations) during the breeding season, 10 during the brood-rearing season (591, 11,743), and 7 during the winter season (288, 4,862). RSF surfaces were transformed to HSIs and averaged in a GIS framework for each pixel for each season. Validation analyses of categorized HSI surfaces using a suite of independent datasets resulted in an agreement of 93\u201397 percent for habitat versus non-habitat on an annual basis. Breeding and brood rearing maps validated similarly well at 94-97 percent, while winter maps validated slightly less accurately at 87-93 percent. We provide an updated example of how space use models can be integrated with habitat models to help inform conservation planning. Using data, we combined probabilistic breeding density with a non-linear probability of occurrence relative to distance to nearest lek (traditional breeding ground) using count data to calculate the AUI. The AUI was then classified into two categories of use (high and low-to-no) and intersected with the HSI categories to create potential management prioritization scenarios based on information about sage-grouse occupancy coupled with habitat suitability. The spatially explicit data herein provide updated measures (in comparison to Coates et al. 2014, 2016) of areal extent (i.e., acres) classified within the four habitat suitability and four management categories. Importantly, seasonal and annual maps represent habitat for all age and sex classes of sage-grouse (that is; sample sizes of marked grouse were insufficient to only construct models for reproductive females). This revised sage-grouse habitat mapping product helps improve adaptive application of conservation planning tools based on intersections of spatially-explicit habitat suitability, abundance, and space use indices.<br>\n<br>\nREFERENCES: Coates, P.S., Casazza, M.L., Brussee, B.E., Ricca, M.A., Gustafson, K.B., Overton, C.T., Sanchez-Chopitea, E., Kroger, T., Mauch, K., Niell, L., Howe, K., Gardner, S., Espinosa, S., and Delehanty, D.J. 2014, Spatially explicit modeling of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat in Nevada and northeastern California\u2014A decision-support tool for management: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2014-1163, 83 p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20141163.

The template also identifies those areas where land use changes have minimal impact. To inform greater sage-grouse conservation planning, the researchers developed greater sage-grouse habitat management categories based on habitat selection indices (HSI) and greater sage-grouse abundance and space-use index (AUI).

                "body": "Greater sage-grouse ( \n<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>; hereinafter, sage-grouse) are a sagebrush obligate species that has declined concomitantly with the loss and fragmentation of sagebrush ecosystems across most of its geographical range. The species has been considered for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act multiple times, and was most recently ruled to not warrant protection as of September 2015. Nevertheless, the species faces threats from increasing wildfire frequency and changing climate, which are identified&nbsp;frequently as two environmental drivers contributing to declines of sage-grouse populations. To help inform a threat assessment within the Great Basin for listing sage-grouse in 2015 under the ESA, we conducted an extensive analysis of wildfire and climatic effects on sage-grouse population growth derived from 30 years of lek-count data collected across the hydrographic Great Basin of Western North America. Annual (1984\u20132013) patterns of wildfire were derived from an extensive dataset of remotely sensed 30-meter imagery and precipitation derived from locally downscaled spatially explicit data. In the sagebrush ecosystem, underlying soil conditions also contribute strongly to variation in resilience to disturbance and resistance to plant community changes (R&amp;R). Thus, we developed predictions from models of post-wildfire recovery and chronic effects of wildfire based on three spatially explicit R&amp;R classes derived from soil moisture and temperature regimes. We found evidence of an interaction between the effects of wildfire (chronically affected burned area within 5 kilometers of a lek) and climatic conditions (spring through fall precipitation) after accounting for a consistent density-dependent effect. Specifically, burned areas near leks nullifies population growth that normally follows years with relatively high precipitation. In models, this effect results in long-term population declines for sage-grouse despite cyclic periods of high precipitation. Based on 30-year projections of burn and recovery rates, our population model predicted steady and substantial long-term declines in population size across the Great Basin. Further, example management scenarios that may help offset adverse wildfire effects are provided by models of varying levels of fire suppression and post-wildfire restoration that focus on areas especially important to sage-grouse populations. These models illustrate how sage-grouse population persistence likely will be compromised as sagebrush ecosystems and sage-grouse habitat are degraded by wildfire, especially in a warmer and drier climate, and by invasion of annual grasses that can increase wildfire frequency and size in the Great Basin."

The mineral-resources tracts are geographic areas that were assessed by the USGS and were determined to be geologically favorable for a deposit type of interest to a depth of 1 kilometer. Qualitative assessment methods outlined by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) were used to develop tract boundaries and to assign a level of mineral-resource potential and certainty to each tract. The general process included (1) identifying possible mineral deposit types for locatable commodities specified by BLM for each focal area, (2) outlining those areas that potentially contained mineral deposits based on geology, mineral occurrences, geophysics, soil and stream-sediment geochemistry, alteration mineral assemblages inferred from satellite imagery, BLM claims and permit data, mineral-exploration activity, and existing mineral-resource assessment data, and (3) evaluating the level of mineral-resource potential and level of certainty associated with the outlined areas using BLM assessment categories. A full description of the assessment is provided in the accompanying report (Day and others, 2016).<br>\n<br>\nSFAs, identified by agencies of the DOI, are high-quality sagebrush habitat areas supporting high densities of breeding greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). SFAs are within priority habitat areas or areas where land-use measures are intended to minimize or avoid habitat disturbance. Seven SFAs are within the USGS Sagebrush Mineral-Resource Assessment Project study area. They include the Bear River Watershed, North-Central Idaho, North-Central Montana, Southeastern Oregon and North-Central Nevada, Sheldon-Hart Mountain National Wildlife Refuge Complex, Southern Idaho and Northern Nevada, and Southwestern and South-Central Wyoming SFAs, as well as additional areas in Nevada (termed the \u201cNevada additions\u201d) proposed by the State of Nevada. Landscape-scale conservation efforts by the BLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), State agencies, private land owners, and other partners are striving to conserve the breeding sagebrush habitat for the greater sage-grouse across these areas.<br>\n<br>\nAccompanying report (Chapter A): Day, W.C., Hammarstrom, J.M., Zientek, M.L., and Frost, T.P., eds., 2016, Overview with methods and procedures of the U.S. Geological Survey mineral-resource assessment of the Sagebrush Focal Areas of Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2016\u20135089, 211 p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20165089.<br>\n<br>\nTo quickly view the data, please access the ScienceBase interactive map viewer via the \"Map\" link in the upper-right corner of this page.

                "body": "Expanding human enterprise across remote environments impacts many wildlife species, including sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>), an indicator species whose decline is at the center of national conservation strategies and land use policies. Anthropogenic resources provide subsidies for generalist predators, potentially leading to cascading effects on sensitive prey species at lower trophic levels. In semi-arid western ecosystems, common ravens (<em>Corvus corax</em>) are expanding in distribution and abundance, and may be negatively affecting sage-grouse reproductive success at broad spatial scales. Ravens are a common predator of sage-grouse nests, and potentially prey on chicks as well. This research aimed to address the growing demand for information about potential interactions between subsidized predators (i.e. ravens) and species they prey upon. More specifically, our objectives were to disentangle natural and anthropogenic influences on raven occurrence at a landscape scale, and provide spatially explicit models and scientific products to help inform decisions regarding the management of ravens and conservation of sage-grouse. Using Bayesian hierarchical occupancy models, we mapped the broad-scale occurrence of common ravens as a function of natural and anthropogenic landscape covariates using more than 15,000 point count surveys performed during 2007\u20132016 within the Great Basin region, USA. In addition, we provide spatially explicit model-predicted surfaces that integrate anthropogenic and natural effects on raven occurrence with underlying information about breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach meets several objectives with respect to the conservation and management of sage-grouse and ravens. First, we established landscape-level patterns of predicted raven occurrence across the Great Basin region. Second, we determined associations between anthropogenic and natural features, and the broad-scale occurrence of ravens. Third, we identified regions where A) high predicted raven occurrence overlapped with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas, and B) areas where raven occurrence was strongly influenced by anthropogenic (vs. natural) variables overlapping with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas. This approach can guide management decisions where subsidized predators overlap sensitive prey habitats. For example, management applications could focus on reducing raven access to anthropogenic subsidies in areas where elevated raven occurrence coincides with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas and appears to be largely driven by anthropogenic factors, while prioritizing habitat improvements for sage-grouse elsewhere. Our approach is applicable to other species where widespread survey data are available.<br>\n<br>\nThese data support the following publication:<br>\nO\u2019Neil, S.T., Coates, P.S., Brussee, B.E., Jackson, P.J., Howe, K.B., Moser, A.M., Foster, L.J., and Delehanty, D.J. 2018, Broad-scale occurrence of a subsidized avian predator: reducing impacts of ravens on sage-grouse and other sensitive prey. <em>Journal of Applied Ecology&nbsp;</em>"

Greater sage-grouse population change (percent change) in a high oil and gas development, low population estimate scenario, and with no effects of climate change (2006-2062)<br>\n<br>\nThe oil and gas development scenario were based on an energy footprint model that simulates well, pad, and road patterns for oil and gas recovery options that vary in well types (vertical and directional) and number of wells per pad and use simulation results to quantify physical and wildlife-habitat impacts. I applied the model to assess tradeoffs among 10 conventional and directional-drilling scenarios in a natural gas field in southwestern Wyoming (see Garman 2017).<br>\n<br>\nThe effects climate change on sagebrush were developed using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM, version 4) climate model and representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario (emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century). The projected climate scenario was used to estimate the change in percent cover of sagebrush (see Homer et al. 2015).<br>\n<br>\nThe percent changes in sage-grouse population sizes represented in these data are modeled using an individual-based population model that simulates dynamics of populations by tracking movements of individuals in dynamically changing landscapes, as well as the fates of individuals as influenced by spatially heterogeneous demography.<br>\n<br>\nWe developed a case study to assess how spatially explicit individual based modeling could be used to evaluate future population outcomes of gradual landscape change from multiple stressors. For Greater sage-grouse in southwest Wyoming, we projected oil and gas development footprints and climate-induced vegetation changes fifty years into the future. Using a time-series of planned oil and gas development and predicted climate-induced changes in vegetation, we re-calculated habitat selection maps to dynamically modify future habitat quantity, quality, and configuration. We simulated long-term sage-grouse responses to habitat change by allowing individuals to adjust to shifts in habitat availability and quality. The use of spatially explicit individual-based modeling offered an important means of evaluating delayed indirect impacts of landscape change on wildlife population outcomes.

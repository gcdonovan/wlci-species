In the Southeast black bears persist in habitats that contain nutrient rich seasonal foods, sufficient den habitat and which are sufficiently remote to protect them from human exploitation (Pelton 1986). Black bears use a variety of habitats in different stages of vegetation succession, due to the seasonality of their food sources. Foods of black bears have been shown to include ants and insect larvae and some meat during all seasons (Clapp 1990, Powell 1997), grasses, forbes and buds in the spring (Clapp 1990), squaw root and old acorns in early summer (Powell 1997), berries and fruits in the summer and fall and hard mast of acorns and nuts in the fall and early winter (Eagle and Pelton 1980, Pelton 1982, Clapp 1990). Mammals, including deer are a rare food source (Powell 1997). In the Fall bears rely on high nutrient food sources to store fat for the winter and for reproduction. These foods include soft mast species which fruit throughout the winter in upland habitats of the piedmont and coastal plain. Hard mast such as acorns and gum fruit from the Nyssa genus are important for reproduction in the fall (Maehr 1984, Clapp 1990, Dobey et al. 2002,). Habitat quality directly affects the reproductive success through its effects on pre- and post-natal nutrition (Rogers 1977, Elowe and Dodge 1989, Dobey et al. 2002). Bears in the south tend to exist in regions of remote pine plantation timberlands and bottomland swamps (Hellgren et.al 1993). In this habitat matrix black bears were reported to use riparian habitats (also associated with hardwood species) in greater proportion to their availability (Stratman et al. 2001). Oak-hickory and mixed hardwood-pine forests provide hard mast foods and were selected over pine forests by black bears in Arkansas (Clark et al. 1993). Early successional habitats such as clearcuts provide high densities of soft mast species and may be exploited by congregated bears that display little aggressive behavior (Powell 1997, Rogers 1987). Agricultural habitats are also exploited (Allen 1999, Beausoleil 1999). Black bears were observed to spend most time in plantation pine in the Okeefenokee Swamp, however scat analysis of diet revealed that bears were foraging on black gum. These results were explained by the fact that radio-tracking was done only during daylight hours and that bears were using pine as escape cover from hunters (Dobey et al. 2002). Bears forage in agricultural habitats adjacent to forest and may be able to exist soley on agricultural crops in highly fragmented forest, provided that they are not poached and there is a year round crop supply (Beausoleil 1999). These findings demonstrate the value of general forest cover to bear populations. Forest fragmentation and road density, in the southeast has been correlated with the absence of breeding black bears.  Researchers suggest that bears can persist in areas with a threshold of road density (Hellgren and Maehr 1993), but no range of density has been suggested. Low traffic volume, remote roads were selected by bears, likely due to the abundance of soft mast along road edges (Smith 1985, Garner 1986, Hellgren and Vaughn 1988, Hellgren et al. 1991). However in areas where bears are commonly hunted or poached, bears tend to avoid roads (Hamilton 1978, Carr and Pelton 1984). Low recruitment and high mortality were correlated with remote road density in Arizona (Mollohan and Lecount 1989). In protected areas high traffic volume roads were avoided (Garner 1986) and crossing was less frequent (Brody and Pelton 1989). Bears avoided habitats within 120 m of roads in Arkansas (Clark 1991). In Florida some black bear populations  were reduced by up to 8 % annually due to traffic collisions (Simek et. Al 2005). Illegal hunting efficiency can increase with road access (Trombulak and Frissell 2000). Evidence suggests that bears that cross heavily trafficked roads less frequently, may shift their home ranges to avoid intolerable road densities or may be obligated to cross roads more frequently than they would normally prefer, to access necessary food resources (Brody and Pelton 1989).  Forest fragmentation may act as a surrogate to road density for predicting the occurrence of bears. Rudis and Tansey (1995) showed that black bear population occurrence in the southeast correlated with counties containing more than 160 km2 of bottomland harwood, hydric woodland, or timberlands. In Florida annecdotal evidence suggests that the minimum unit of forested area that can be considered occupied bear range  is 100 square kilometers  (Maehr et. al 2001). The minimum size of public lands occupied by bears in Florida was 10km2 (Hellgren and Maehr 1993). Black bear home range size and use in the southeastern US depend on seasonal food abundance (Powell et al.,1997) and human activity along roads (Brody and Pelton 1989). Female black bear home range use depends in part on male defense of the most productive habitats (Jonkel and Cowan 1971) and avoidance of aggressive males due to the threat of infanticide (Powell et al. 1997, Rogers 1987). Where resources are limiting, black bears exhibit territorial behavior in the northern US (Rogers 1987, Samson 2001). However, habitats are generally more productive in the southeast and consequently female bear home ranges tend to overlap (Garshelis and Pelton 1981, Smith and Pelton 1990).  Average annual home range size for female bears in southeast Georgia in the Okefenokee Swamp have been estimated to be as high as 57.9 km2 for females with cubs and 95.8 km2 for solitary females, whereas solitary and with cub female home range sizes in the adjacent Osceola National Forest in Florida were less than half the size of solitary and with cub females in the Okefenokee (Dobey et al. 2005). Seasonal home ranges in north Georgia for females have been estimated at 8.9 to 13.8 km2 for summer, and 11.4 to 14 km2 during the fall, whereas male black bear home ranges were reported as 15  to 41.6 km2 for summer, and 12.9  to 24.4 km2 during the fall (Brody and Pelton 1989). The difference in home ranges between the north Georgia, the Okefenokee and Osceola bears is likely due to habitat productivity (Dobey et.all 2005). Bear habitats in the Okefenokee are interspersed with flooded areas within swamps, and thus food and shelter resources are more widely dispersed, necessitating exploitation of larger home ranges. In the Mississippi alluvial valley, a riparian environment in the southeastern US, males maintained annual home ranges averaging 68.5 km2 compared to 10.5 km2 for females (White 1996). Den habitat can be critical to cub survival and black bear reproductive rate. Bears using ground dens without sufficient cover tend to exhibit decreased survival and productivity (Johnson and Pelton 1981). Black bears in the southeastern US select den sites primarily in large trees when they are available (White 1996), or in rock crevices (Clark et al. 1998). Ground dens dug under slash and downed trees are used in areas of timber harvest (White 1996). Black bears in the southeast exhibit habitat selection on timber harvest lands. Female black bears in Arkansas selected immature and mature poletimber oak-hickory stands and avoided immature and mature sawtimber pine stands (Clark 1991), however during daylight hours, while bears are most likely resting, pine habitats were selected in the Okefenokee Swamp (Dobey et. al 2005). Clearcuts were selected by male and female black bears in North Carolina due to high abundance of soft mast species (Brody 1984). Clearcuts were not selected by female bears with cubs in Arkansas, potentially due to avoidance of males who defended the use of these habitats (Clark 1991).  \r\nModel parameters were based on the following findings. In North Carolina Beringer et al. (1990) reported maximum home range road density for highwaysas 0.5 km/km2. For gravel and paved roads density was 0.7 km/km2 and  restricted remote forest road density was 1.6 km/km2l. Mykytka and Pelton (1990) report maximum road densities for paved and graded roads in Florida, within the composite home range as 0.68 Km/km2. The minimum size of public lands occupied by bears in Florida was 10km2 (Helgren and Maehr 1993). This also corresponds to the range of the smallest average MCP home range sizes reported for females in the southeast (White 1996,  Garshelis and Pelton 1981, Smith and Pelton 1989). A road density mask of 0.7 km/km2 was used for a moving window size of 100,000 ha. Windows with 800 ha. of habitat will be classed as having potential black bear occurrence. Habitat is considered to be all selected forest Mus, clear cuts, and agricultural areas within 300m of forest. The distance to forest was based on an assumption for escape cover and from bear location data from GPS collared males in central Georgia (Cook et al. unpublished data), where maximum distance to forest was 300m which represented less than 5% of locations.\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nBears denned in a variety of habitats. Mixed conifer forests (45%), pinyon-juniper woodlands (21%), spruce-fir forests (13%), ponderosa pine forests (9%), oak shrublands (8%). Bears are mostly restricted to forested and wooded areas. In Colorado, the species is most common in montane shrublands and forests and subalpine forests at moderate elevations, especially areas with well-developed stands of oakbrush or berry-producing shrubs (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Also occupy habitats ranging from edge of alpine tundra to lower foothills and canyon country (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Black bear is one of mammals typical of Montane Coniferous Forest in New Mexico. In Nevada, known only from the Sierra Nevada in the vicinity of Lake Tahoe (Hall 1995). In many places in Arizona, black bears are usually in riparian communities. Likely productive habitat for black bears was bottomland hardwood timberland, hydric woodland, and reserved timberland. Black bears in Arizona are associated with mountain ranges, but in the mountains they may live from semidesert grasslands through encinal wood- lands to montane conifer forests. In spring and early summer they are lower down the mountains, later they move up the mountains where there is plentiful forage. In many places in Arizona black bear are usually in riparian communities. Bailey said \"\u2026they live mainly in the Transition Zone timber areas high up on the cold slopes\u2026. From this area they range down into the oak country in autumn where acorns are abundant (Hoffmeister 1986). In the Trans-Pecos of west Texas, riparian areas in the desert mountains serve as primary black bear habitat. Oak and sotol are among the most important food-producing species.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mABBEx", "ELCode": "AMAJB01010", "scientific_name": "Ursus americanus", "ITIS_TSN": "180544", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100661", "common_name": "American Black Bear"}}, "GAP ITIS Information": {"hierarchySoFarWRanks": {"Kingdom": "Animalia", "Family": "Ursidae", "Subkingdom": "Bilateria", "Subclass": "Theria", "Order": "Carnivora", "Infraclass": "Eutheria", "Phylum": "Chordata", "Infraphylum": "Gnathostomata", "Superclass": "Tetrapoda", "Suborder": "Caniformia", "Infrakingdom": "Deuterostomia", "Subphylum": "Vertebrata", "Genus": "Ursus", "Class": "Mammalia", "Species": "Ursus americanus"}}}}, {"processing_metadata": {"status": "success", "date_processed": "2019-08-07T15:37:13.338500", "status_message": "Exact Match", "api": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=527d0a83e4b0850ea0518326&format=json&fields=identifiers,files,webLinks,distributionLinks,dates&filter=itemIdentifier%3D{'key': 'Tamiasciurus hudsonicus'}"}, "parameters": {"Scientific Name": "Tamiasciurus hudsonicus"}, "GAP Species": {"GAP Habitat Map Item": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58fa76aee4b0b7ea54525ab8", "GAP Range Map Item": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59f5e21ce4b063d5d307dcad", "GAP Habitat Map WMS": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/geoserver/CONUS_HabMap_2001/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities", "GAP Modeling Database Parameters URL": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/58fa76aee4b0b7ea54525ab8?f=__disk__22%2F20%2F48%2F222048f85f1310a2f9dc3ae2a54b0b57463740e9", "GAP ITIS Information URL": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/58fa76aee4b0b7ea54525ab8?f=__disk__42%2F84%2F60%2F42846086def594663ba4a65633ef9e7a99afff42", "GAP Habitat Map File Size": 206094473, "GAP Habitat Map Last Updated": "2019-02-08T12:16:04.932-07:00", "GAP_SpeciesCode": "mRESQx", "CommonName": "Red Squirrel", "ScientificName": "Tamiasciurus hudsonicus", "doi": "doi:10.5066/F7PC30S2", "itis_tsn_validMatch": "180166", "nsid_acceptedMatch": "104800", "iucn_id_verified": "42587", "GAP Range Map WMS": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/geoserver/CONUS_Range_2001/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities", "Range Bounding Box": [-121.51139378655276, 32.329210080576274, -66.9017614483196, 49.384366329079675], "GAP Modeling Database Parameters": {"doi": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC30S2", "input_layers": {"intEdgeEcoWidth": {"Forest/Open Ecotone Only": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "F/O + Shrubland/Woodland": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7T43RZ7"}, "strAvoid": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "ysnHydroWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strForIntBuffer": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "intFromBuffFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intSlopeMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F75D8QQF", "intIntoBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intElevMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F72N515B", "intSlopeMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F75D8QQF", "PrimEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "AuxEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "hucs": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7DZ0754", "intIntoBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intPercentCanopy": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7DZ0754", "ysnUrbanExclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "intElevMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F72N515B", "Region": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F77H1HGT", "ysnHydroOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "ysnUrbanInclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "strUseForInt": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "intFromBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strStreamVel": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strEdgeType": {"Forest/Open Ecotone Only": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "F/O + Shrubland/Woodland": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7T43RZ7"}, "strSalinity": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "ysnHydroFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intFromBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1"}, "sb_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58fa76aee4b0b7ea54525ab8", "models": {"mRESQx-y1": {"intPercentCanopy": null, "intIntoBuffFW": null, "ScientificName": "Tamiasciurus hudsonicus", "ysnHydroWV": false, "intAuxBuff": null, "strForIntBuffer": null, "intContPatchSize": null, "ysnHandModel": false, "intSlopeMin": null, "intIntoBuffOW": null, "Season": "y", "intElevMax": 3660, "intSlopeMax": null, "PrimEcoSys": [[9826, "Northwestern Great Plains Floodplain"], [4609, "Northern Rocky Mountain Mesic Montane Mixed Conifer Forest"], [4547, "North Pacific Dry-Mesic Silver Fir-Western Hemlock-Douglas-fir Forest"], [4319, "North Pacific Dry Douglas-fir-(Madrone) Forest and Woodland"], [9306, "North Pacific Hardwood-Conifer Swamp"], [9823, "Western Great Plains Floodplain"], [9304, "Northern Rocky Mountain Conifer Swamp"], [1202, "Developed, Low Intensity"], [8401, "Introduced Upland Vegetation -

Their inhabit much of the Northeast and Midwest as well as the s. Appalachians and western mountain ranges.  In Among the locations of known southwestern populations are northeast, central, southwest, and southeast mountains of Utah (Durrant 1952), the Kaibab Plateau, the Mogollon Plateau, the Wasatch Plateau, and on several mountains: Manzano Mountains, Pinaleno Mountains, Sacramento Mountains, San Juan Mountains, Sangre de Cristo, San Francisco, White, Mogollon, Chuska, Jemez, Zuni, Mt. Taylor, San Mateo, Wasatch, Taos Mountains, Capitan Mountains, Black Range, Lukachukai Mountains, Tunitcha Mountains, Mimbres Mountains, Gallinas, Blue Range, Mt. Thomas, Pecos Mountains, Elk Mountain, Abajo Mountains, Uinta Mountains, and La Sal Mountain. A report of the species in the Zuni Mountains may be incorrect (Frey 2004).  Arizona, it occurs along the Mogollon Rim, on the Kaibab Plateau, in northeast Apache County, and in the Pinaleno (Graham) Mountains (Hoffmeister 1986).  It occurs in the western half of Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994), and is found in the mountains of the western two-thirds of New Mexico (Findley 1975, Frey 2004).  In North Dakota, they are restricted to the Black Hills and they are not found in KS or NE (Koprowski 2005).\r\n\tThe Mt. Graham Red Squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis) is an Endangered subspecies of Red Squirrel that only occurs in the Pinaleno mountains of AZ (USFWS 2011).  They once ranged east to Turkey Flat and west to West Peak, but now only as far west as Clark Peak.  Historically found in mature and old-growth high-elevation, closed-canopy, mixed conifer and spruce-fir forests, most individuals currently inhabit mixed-conifer forests.  Their population has been declining due to insect outbreaks, wildfires, and fire suppression.  Middens have been found up to 3,268 m and as low as 2,353 m, but they are believed to have historically resided above 2,425 m.  A habitat suitability model was built for this subspecies and it associated the species with mixed conifer forests, ecotones, and spruce-fir forests above 2,744m or above 2,353 on north or east aspect slopes with less than a 45-degree slope (USFWS 2011).\r\n\tConifer seeds are a major component of Red Squirrel\u2019s diets, and suitable habitat is frequently associated with the presence of coniferous trees.  They have been noted as being particularly abundant where there are spruce and hemlock trees (Webster et al. 1985; Linzey and Linzey 1971).  However, forest type may not be as important to the squirrel as the availability of food and shelter.  They are present in most coniferous forest types from high elevation spruce-fir and lodgepole pine to low elevation ponderosa pine, jack pine, and pinyon pine (Koprowski 2005, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  They can also occur in deciduous forests in New England and north-central states where they feed on any nuts and seeds available, buds, leaves, bark, and tree flowers (Godin 1977, Jones and Birney 1988).  They also inhabit mixed riparian forests with aspen and cottonwoods, open forests, second growth forests, urban development, suburban parklands, mixed and northern hardwood forests at high elevations in the southern Appalachians (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998), mixed coniferous forests (Thompson et al. 1996), riparian cottonwood or blue spruce stands (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Thompson et al. 1996), alpine fir and yellow pine, hemlock groves, larch swamp, and pine-cedar-birch forests (Thompson et al. 1996).  Layne (1954) reported that Red Squirrels near Ithica NY inhabited beech-maple-hemlock forests; mixed hardwoods with scattered conifers; coniferous plantations; old orchards; hedgerows; park-like areas; and \u201cedificarian\u201d.  Their use of hedgerows and orchards was related to availability of food.  Commercial thinning of forests may reduce densities but does not exclude this species completely (Koprowski 2005).  The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish (2000) reported the species in oak mountain scrub and montane grassland.  Less desirable habitat includes ponderosa pine forests, Douglas-fir forests, planted Norway spruce (Picea abies) and red pine (Pinus resinosa; Steele 1998, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).   Abert\u2019s squirrels often displace red squirrels from ponderosa pine forests (Kaprowski 2005).\r\nRed Squirrels are associated with high elevation areas in the Southeast and West.  They occur above 500 m in the southern Appalachians (Steele 1998); above 2500 m in AZ and NM; above 1,800 m in CO and WY (Koprowski 2005).  Fitzgerald et al (1994) reported a range of 1,830-3,660 m.  In the San Francisco Peaks, they are found mainly above 2,591m in Engelmann spruce, corkbark fir, bristlecone pine and Douglas-fir (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).\r\nRed squirrels are very adaptable in establishing their shelters.  They use abandoned woodpecker cavities, holes in the ground or crevices in rocky places, or will build a nest of available materials (sticks, leaves or bark, or some combination thereof) in the crotch or branch of a tree (Hamilton 1964).  Old nests of crows and hawks are also used.  Activity outside the nest ceases when air temperatures fall below -32 degrees Celcius (Fitzgerald et al 1994).  Home range is 1-6 acres (NatureServe 2001).  Breeds March-April and June-July in Quebec. Gestation lasts 31-35 days (Lair 1985).  Some females produce 2 liters per year with an average littersize of 4-5.  Some females breed when less than one year old (Lair 1986). N.

As of May 2013, the species is comprised of five subspecies, but one, A. b. nevadensis, is likely to be elevated to species status. Four subspecies live in the U.S.\r\n\r\nIn general, Sage Sparrows are associated shrub-steppe communities in the northern portion of their range and chaparral and shrub lands of the southern part.  However, shrub type may be less important than vertical structure, patchiness, shrub spacing, and vegetation density (Martin and Carlson 1998); they breed in semi-open scrublands with evenly spaced shrubs 1 -2 m high (Chase and Carlson 2002).  They are reportedly less common in fragmented shrub lands (Chase and Carlson 2002).\r\n\r\nIn transmontane CA, they can be found in sagebrush, alkali desert scrub, and desert scrub; and in cismontane CA, they can be found in chamise and coastal scrub. (Zeiner et al. 1990).  They have not been found in canyons within the city of San Diego (Chase and Carlson 2002).\r\n\r\nThe Bell\u2019s Sage Sparrow (Artemisiospiza belli belli) lives in dry chaparral and coastal sage scrub of brittlebush, black sage, California buckwheat, California sagebrush, bush mallow, chamise, white sage, valley cholla, ceonothus, willow and bunchgrasses (Martin and Carlson 1998; Cicero 2010).  It prefers California sagebrush and brittlebush.  Chamise chaparral  is used in northern part of its range and in coastal San Diego County along with redshanks.  At higher elevations in the sourthern CA mountains, sagebrush is used (Chase and Carlson 2002).  They are less common in tall, dense, old chaparral (Chase and Carlson 2002).  Records exist of this species between 1219-1829 m in July in California.\r\n\r\nArtemisiospiza belli canescens occurs in drier desert scrub habitats of saltbush, shadscale, bitterbrush, big sagebrush, and rabbitbrush (Cicero 2010).  It is sometimes found in creosote bush-goldenhead desert scrub.  Individuals have been documented between 1219-1829 m in July in California and the type specimen was recorded in 1905 at 1676 m.  Some individuals are believed to move up in elevation following breeding (Cicero 2010).\r\n\r\nThe San Clemente Sage Sparrow (Artemisiospiza belli clementeae) is only found on San Clemente Island, CA in maritime desert scrub (Martin and Carlson 2002, Cicero 2010).\r\n\r\nThe Great Basin Sage Sparrow (Artemisiospiza belli nevadensis) is found in Great Basin sagebrush, either pure stands or those interspersed with bitterbrush, saltbrush, shadscale, rabbitbrush or greasewood (Martin and Carlson 1998).  They are rare in mixed sagebrush-juniper except where adjacent to shrub-steppe (Martin and Carlson 1998).  They have been documented up to 2400 m in elevation but usually breed below 1700 m (Martin and Carlson 1998, Cicero 2010).\r\n\r\nDuring winter, Great Basin Sage Sparrows migrate south while the other subspecies either move short distances or remain on their breeding grounds.  Winter habitats include breeding habitats as well as desert washes, creosote bush, sparse cactus scrub, arid grasslands, arboreal yucca mixed with greasewood and honey mesquite and inkweed communities along the Colorado River (Martin and Carlson 1998).  N. Tarr, 20May2013.\r\n\r\nPrefers semi-open habitats with evenly spaced shrubs 1-2 meters apart (Martin and Carlson 1998).  Vertical structure, habitat patchiness and vegetation density may be more important in habitat selection than specific shrub species (Martin and Carlson 1998).  Overgrown chaparral stands have generally fewer sage sparrows than shorter shrubs recovering from fire (Martin and Carlson 1998).   Prefers to breed in low desert scrub of saltbush, bitterbrush, big sagebrush and shadscale, but also uses creosotebush-goldenhead desertscrub (Martin and Carlson 1998). Breeds occasionally in mixed sagebrush juniper habitat adjacent to shrub-steppe habitat (Martin and Carlson 1998). Winters in big sagebrush in the northern part of its range; in desert washes, big sagebrush, creosotebush, sparse cactus scrub, arid grasslands, and arboreal yucca mixed with greasewood in more southern areas (Martin and Carlson 1998). In winter in the Sonoran desert in southern California, this species dwell in creosote bush-saltbush shrubland on valley floors (Repasky 1996).  In southern Idaho, the sage sparrow is almost entirely dependent on sagebrush for breeding habitat (Rich 1978).  Can be found in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) with cholla (Opuntia imbricata) in association with prairie dog towns (Clark et al. 1982).  In Arizona, this is a common summer resident on open sagebrush on the Navajo Indian Reservation (Phillips and Monson 1964).  Winters commonly on open ground with sparse brush in southwestern and western Arizona, and in Upper Sonoran grasslands of northern Arizona (Phillips and Monson 1964). In Colorado, these birds nest only in large stands at lower elevations of big sagebrush or mixed big sagebrush and greasewood (Kingery 1998).  In Nevada, this bird is found throughout the state in sagebrush areas; in Clark County it is a summer resident in woodlands, winter resident in desert scrub and riparian areas (Alcorn 1988).  In New Mexico, this species is confined to the northwest corner of the state in the summer, where big sagebrush occurs in large stands; in winter it is statewide (Ligon 1961).  In the lower Colorado River Valley of Arizona, this species occurs where there are dense patches of inkweed interspersed with bare ground in moderately dense honey mesquite woodlands or desert washes (Rosenberg et al. 1991). A. b. nevadensis will breed in creosote bush in wet years but not in dry years (Martin and Carlson 1998).

Idaho, w. Wyoming and s.w. Montana (Durrant 1952, Zeveloff 1988). The Green River is believed to be a barrier to its distribution to the east (Svihla 1931).  In Utah, the Wasatch Front marks its extreme western limit with the exception of the Raft River Mountains in the nw corner, where they are relatively abundant (Berryman 1948, Durrant 1952).  It occurs in abundance locally but presence is spotty within its limited range (Yensen 1999). \r\n\r\nThey generally inhabit large, open areas in mountains, foothills, and high valleys such as cultivated fields, lawns, pastures, montane and subalpine grassy meadows, sagebrush shrublands, and sagebrush-steppe  (Durrant 1952; Balph and Stokes 1963; Knopf and Balph 1977; Parmenter and MacMahon 1983; Zeveloff 1988; Rieger 1996; Yensen 1999; Eshelmann and Sonnemann 2000).    \r\n\r\nIn the Raft River Mountains of nw Utah, colonies were in a big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata)- snowberry (Symphoricarpos utahensis) shrubland with forbs and grasses (Poa spp.) in the understory (Berryman 1948).  Knopf and Balph (1977) note a population in northern Utah occurring around a corral along an interface of sagebrush and aspen at the subalpine zone (2438 m).  In the Bridger-Teton National Park, Wyoming, McGee (1982) found the species in unburned, dense, homogenous stands of  mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata vaseyana) with grasses and forbs forming a continuous understory.  It also had been found in sagebrush-steppe in Wyoming, where dominant shrubs were big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus) with endemic and introduced grasses such as Agropyron spp., Poa spp., Stipa spp., Bromus tectorum, Elymus elymoides, Oryzopsis hymenoides, and Hordeum jubatum (Parmenter and MacMahon 1983; Minta 1992).  Uses agricultural areas; for example, Uinta ground squirrels used a pasture in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, composed of mostly Kentucky blue grass (Poa spp.) but also bromegrass (Brome spp.) and dandelions (Taraxacum spp.) (Rieger 1996).  Knopf and Balph (1977) note a population in an area bordering irrigated alfalfa fields in Cache Valley, Utah. The species has also been found in developed areas, such as in lawns among buildings of the Utah State University Experimental Station, and on the University of Utah campus (Balph and Stokes 1963; Slade and Balph 1974; Balph 1984).\r\n \r\nSeems to favor well-drained, soft-bottomed areas for burrows rather than rocky hillsides; these areas may include mine spoil pits and banks of stream and canals ( Svihla 1931; Berryman 1948; Durrant 1952; Parmenter and MacMahon 1983).  However, in the literature there was no mention of any association with a particular soil type, therefore we do not use the soils layer in this model.  In Utah, burrows were often located beneath sagebrush shrubs (Berrryman 1948).  \r\n\r\nFound at elevations from 1219 m along the Snake River in Idaho (Eshelman and Sonnemann 2000) up to 3048 m near Brighton, Utah (Durrant 1952), but usually occurs below 2438 m (Zeveloff 1988).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mUGSQx", "ELCode": "AMAFB05050", "scientific_name": "Urocitellus armatus", "ITIS_TSN":

It inhabits open areas with sparse vegetation, such as originally occurred in sandy short-grass prairie, but shrublands, beaches, and dry pine barrens are also used (NatureServe2014).  This species appears to be much more abundant and more widely distributed than it was a century ago, for much shortgrass habitat suitable to its needs, such as mowed lawns, golf courses, cemeteries, and rights-of-way has been developed by man (Whitaker & Hamilton 1998, Jones and Birney 1988).  In CO they prefer low bunchgrasses and inhabit semidesert shrublands, and in MO, they inhabit prairies and occasionally brushy fencerows, woody borders or sandy river bottoms (Schwartz and Schwartz 2001).

All manner of aquatic habitats that can be dammed to form calm pools and ponds are used. They will readily occupy artificial ponds, reservoirs, and canals if food is available. In mountainous areas, beavers typically have the most success at building ponds in valleys and flattened areas. Therefore, populations are more apt to be concentrated at lower elevations (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998; Linzey and Linzey 1971). However, they can be found far up the tributaries of mountain streams (Webster et al. 1985). They generally avoid lakes with strong wave action, fast- moving streams, and greatly fluctuating flow or water levels. In larger rivers beavers use floodplains and backwaters. In the north, they require water that is deep enough such that it does not freeze to the bottom and allows the accumulation of a substantial food pile beneath the ice. Though populations are sporadically distributed, beavers can populate areas quickly and become locally common anywhere except in tidewater habitats (Lee et al. 1982, Webster et al. 1985). They were almost extirpated through trapping before 1900, but they were transplanted in the early 1940s and have increased dramatically. Beavers are noteworthy in their ability to modify their environment, perhaps creating suitable habitat patches for birds and other mammalian species. Beavers build lodges or use burrows in earthen banks (Webster et al. 1985). One or more families may occupy a pond. In the South breeding occurs late October-March and parturition generally occurs late March and early April (Wigley et al. 1983). Litter size ranges from one to nine (3-4 typical). Females normally first give birth on or near their third birthday and may remain productive for up to at least ten years (Stegeman 1954). In most cases, the young disperse from their family group in late winter or early spring at an age of almost two years, before the new kits are born. Dispersal occurs over land and via waterways (Leege 1968).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThis species needs an adequate supply of woody vegetation near a stream. It avoids seasonally fluctuating streams and fast-moving water, and does not prefer rocky streams or shorelines (Novak 1987). In Arizona it lives in continuously flowing waterways, even canals and small streams or streams with limited flow of water if vegetation is suitable (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It utilizes irrigation canals (Frey 2004). The species is found at the Colorado River where the temperature can be well over 120 degrees F (Hoffmeister 1986).  It occurs within a few hundred meters of water (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Plants eaten depend largely upon availability (Davis and Davis 1997).  C. canadensis eats birch, sweetgum, blackgum, bur-reed, duckweeds, pondweeds, clover, alfalfa, corn, mesquite, cattail, and soybeans (Hoffmeister 1986, NatureServe 2001). The minimum territory is 0.4 ha, and the nearest neighbor minimum is 0.7 km (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The home range in Manitoba was 7.7 km (NatureServe 2001). Elevation is from 0-3400m (NatureServe 2001). It is found on slopes up to 15 degrees (Novak 1987). The beaver occurs in most of the major streams and mountain creeks in Arizona, though it is absent from the Santa Cruz River, most of the western part of the Gila River, most of the Little Colorado River, and part of the Salt River (Hoffmeister 1986). Historically it occurred in the San Pedro River, but is now extirpated (Frey 2004). It is found throughout Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species occurs in northern Nevada and along the Colorado River (Hall 1995).

They prefer grasslands, sagebrush plains, deserts and foothills. There is a need for free water with succulent vegetation in their diet. The species inhabits the areas of previous prescribed burns very well. Pronghorns inhabit grasslands and semidesert shrublands on rolling topography that affects good visibility. They are most adundant in short grass or midgrass prairie and less common in xeric habitats. The following characteristics were found on preferred ranges: 1 - ground cover averaged 50% living vegetation; 2 - general composition was 40-60% grass, 10-30% forbs, 5-20% browse; 3 - within the vegetative community there was a variety of species often including 5-10 species of grasses, 20-40 species of forbs, 5-10 species of shrubs; 4 - succulent plants were preferred; 5 - open rangelands with a variety of vegetative types were preferred to menotypic communities; 6 - vegetation averages 15 inches in height, those with vegetation over 30 inches are infrequently used. Pronghorns are residents of bushy grasses and sagebrush flats. Pronghorn is one of mammals typical of Plains-Mesa Grassland which occurs below the Savanna Zone. This grassland is dominated by species such as blue grama, buffalograss, galleta, and dropseed and includes tobosa grass and sacaton in swales. Pronghorn is also associated with Great Basin Desert Scrub in northwestern portion of New Mexico and is dominated by shrubs including big sagebrush and fourwing saltbush with sparse ground cover. Pronghorn occupy shortgrass to midgrass, mixed grass-shrub, and desert habitats. Within these habitats, population numbers are highest when annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 38 cm. The species is common in Utah, where it primarily occurs in desert, grassland, and sagebrush habitats (UDWR, 2003). In Arizona, this species had a good, viable population along the Bill Williams River and north into the valley where Lake Havasu City now stands (Blair 2005). In 1963, at the founding of Lake Havasu City, they shifted their range south to the Aubry Hills and then up the north side of the Bill Williams River (Blair 2005). They continued shifting east toward the Castanada Wash area and the Black Mesa Wilderness (Blair 2005). In California, the pronghorn occurs in the northeast part of the state in Mono County and has been translocated to Kern, San Luis Obispo, and San Benito Counties. It is found only in sagebrush, low sage, bitterbrush, grassland, pinyon-juniper, riparian, and alkali desert scrub habitats ([Hopkins et al.] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mPRONx", "ELCode": "AMALD01010", "scientific_name": "Antilocapra americana", "ITIS_TSN": "180717", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100336", "common_name": "Pronghorn"}}, "GAP ITIS Information": {"hierarchySoFarWRanks": {"Kingdom": "Animalia", "Family": "Antilocapridae", "Subkingdom": "Bilateria", "Subclass": "Theria", "Order": "Artiodactyla", "Infraclass": "Eutheria", "Phylum": "Chordata", "Infraphylum": "Gnathostomata", "Superclass": "Tetrapoda", "Infrakingdom": "Deuterostomia", "Subphylum": "Vertebrata", "Genus": "Antilocapra", "Class": "Mammalia", "Species": "Antilocapra americana"}}}}, {"processing_metadata": {"status": "success", "date_processed": "2019-08-07T15:37:13.338500", "status_message": "Exact Match", "api": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=527d0a83e4b0850ea0518326&format=json&fields=identifiers,files,webLinks,distributionLinks,dates&filter=itemIdentifier%3D{'key': 'Microtus californicus'}"}, "parameters": {"Scientific Name": "Microtus californicus"}, "GAP Species": {"GAP Habitat Map Item": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58fa635fe4b0b7ea545257a1", "GAP Range Map Item": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59f5eba6e4b063d5d307e04f", "GAP Habitat Map WMS": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/geoserver/CONUS_HabMap_2001/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities", "GAP Modeling Database Parameters URL": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/58fa635fe4b0b7ea545257a1?f=__disk__ca%2F1f%2F54%2Fca1f5427cdb9e524b3adf140f8c03207009e42ed", "GAP ITIS Information URL": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/58fa635fe4b0b7ea545257a1?f=__disk__75%2F45%2F50%2F75455058658687e6e15957bdc53df4f6b8a03d91", "GAP Habitat Map File Size": 17265660, "GAP Habitat Map Last Updated": "2019-02-08T12:57:21.572-07:00", "GAP_SpeciesCode": "mCAVOx", "CommonName": "California Vole", "ScientificName": "Microtus californicus", "doi": "doi:10.5066/F70Z71NV", "itis_tsn_validMatch": "180305", "nsid_acceptedMatch": "102779", "iucn_id_verified": "13427", "GAP Range Map WMS": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/geoserver/CONUS_Range_2001/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities", "Range Bounding Box": [-124.47443078528048, 32.5292805487602, -116.05144977882536, 44.68610251878566], "GAP Modeling Database Parameters": {"doi": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F70Z71NV", "input_layers": {"intEdgeEcoWidth": {"Forest/Open Ecotone Only": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "F/O + Shrubland/Woodland": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7T43RZ7"}, "strAvoid": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "ysnHydroWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strForIntBuffer": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "intFromBuffFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intSlopeMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F75D8QQF", "intIntoBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intElevMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F72N515B", "intSlopeMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F75D8QQF", "PrimEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "AuxEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "hucs": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7DZ0754", "intIntoBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intPercentCanopy": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7DZ0754", "ysnUrbanExclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "intElevMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F72N515B", "Region": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F77H1HGT", "ysnHydroOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "ysnUrbanInclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "strUseForInt": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "intFromBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strStreamVel": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strEdgeType": {"Forest/Open Ecotone Only": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "F/O + Shrubland/Woodland": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7T43RZ7"}, "strSalinity": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "ysnHydroFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intFromBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1"}, "sb_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58fa635fe4b0b7ea545257a1", "models": {"mCAVOx-y4": {"intPercentCanopy": null, "intIntoBuffFW": null, "ScientificName": "Microtus californicus", "ysnHydroWV": false, "intAuxBuff": 120.0, "strForIntBuffer": null, "intContPatchSize": null, "ysnHandModel": true, "intSlopeMin": null, "intIntoBuffOW": null, "Season": "y", "intElevMax": null, "intSlopeMax": null, "PrimEcoSys": [[4547, "North Pacific Dry-Mesic Silver Fir-Western Hemlock-Douglas-fir Forest"], [4319, "North Pacific Dry Douglas-fir-(Madrone) Forest and Woodland"], [7401, "California Mesic Serpentine Grassland"], [8406, "Introduced Riparian and Wetland Vegetation"], [9227, "North American Arid West Emergent Marsh"], [9306, "North Pacific Hardwood-Conifer Swamp"], [9304, "Northern Rocky Mountain Conifer Swamp"], [8503, "Ruderal Upland -

Hooven 1972, Verts and Carraway 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCAVOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF11030", "scientific_name": "Microtus californicus", "ITIS_TSN": "180305", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102779",

North American population may have been about 30-60 million (Natureserve). Reduced to about 1650 by 1903 (Natureserve). Population in 1983 was estimated at 75,000 (Natureserve). In Yellowstone NP, the herd was estimated at 3,000-3,500 in 1996 however over 1,000 were killed during the winter of 1996-97 by agency personnel (Natureserve). Prehistoric distribution was primarily on central grasslands and northern parklands of North America, but also used semideserts to boreal forests; where suitable grazing was available (Meagher 1986). Habitat includes the open plains and grasslands in south; woodland and openings in boreal forest, meadows, and river valleys in north (Natureserve).  Historically, bison roamed over much of Colorado, generally on the plains but also in the grasslands of the mountain parks and valleys, semidesert shrublands, pinyon-juniper woodlands, and even ranged onto the alpine tundra (Fitzgerald et al., 1994). In historic times, bison were common and abundant on the eastern plains of New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975). Essentially gone from New Mexico by 1860, the last recorded bison kill was in 1884 (Findley et al. 1975). In 1836 Utah in the Salt Lake Valley there were large number of bison but by 1847 they were practically extinct (Durrant 1952). Bison are herbivores; feeds on grasses, forbs, and sedges (Natureserve). Bison are grazers; in northeastern Colorado shortgrass prairie and at Colorado National Monument, dominate forage is grass (Feldhamer et al. 2003). In shrub-steppe community in southern Utah, bison diet consisted on 93% grasses and sedges (Feldhamer et al. 2003). In northeastern CO, sedges were important only in spring (Feldhamer et al. 2003). In southwestern Colorado, forbs were common food items all year (Feldhamer et al. 2003). Like other large grazers, attracted to burned areas the next growing season (Natureserve). Altitude does not appear to have limited bison distribution in Colorado - there is evidence of bison at 3,903m (Meagher 1986). CWSD has an elevational range of 914-3,960m.\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nTwo herds are located in the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area (LBL) in KY and TN. The original herd of 19 animals from Theodore Roosevelt National Park were reintroduced in 1969 to the South Bison Range - 180 acres of pasture/open grasslands. In 1996, the LBL created a second herd area known as the Elk and Bison Prairie. It consists of 700 acres of woodland/shrublands and grassy pasture-like extension of a small patch of native prairie discovered after controlled burns conducted in the area in 1975.\r\n\r\nGreat Plains/Upper Midwest:\r\nDuring the growing season at the Konza Prairie in northeastern Kansas, preferred areas that had been burned in spring; summer grazing was concentrated in large watershed area (79-119 ha) dominated by warm-season, perennial grasses; in fall and winter, grazed both burned and unburned watersheds more uniformly but grazed most intensively in areas with large stands of cool-season, grasses (Vinton et al. 1993).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mBISOx", "ELCode": "AMALE01010", "scientific_name": "Bison bison", "ITIS_TSN": "180706", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101908",

It is found in a wide variety of areas such as cities, suburbs, farms (Kaufman 1996), and woodland edges near human habitation, especially around horses (Ehrlich et al. 1988).  It is absent from extensive woodlands, forests, grasslands, deserts (Peter and Cink 2006).\r\n\r\nIt is a permanent resident of the Sandia Mountains of New Mexico below 2073 m in the Sandia Mountains (Tatschl 1967).  It is a common, permanent resident in cities, towns, and ranches in Utah (Behle et al. 1985).  Is a widespread common resident in cities and towns in Arizona (Monson and Phillips 1981).  Leadville and Fairplay, Colorado, host the highest elevation populations of this species in North America at 3110m and 3048 m, respectively (Kingery 1998).   It occurs in all counties in Texas.  \r\n\r\nThe House Sparrow prefers to nest in a cavity such as a natural cavity in a tree, an abandoned woodpecker hole, a birdhouse, a hole in a wall, under the eaves of a building, behind a wall-mounted sign, or in the nest of a Cliff or Barn Swallow (Nicholson 1997).  It can be an aggressive competitor with native species for cavities, sometimes ejecting eggs or young.  If a cavity is not available, it will build a nest in the fork of a tree branch up to 40 feet above the ground.  It forages primarily on the ground (Ehrlich et al. 1988) but is an opportunistic feeder and will frequent bird feeders and pick insects from the grill of cars (Kaufman 1996).  N.

Preferences are for fragmented, heterogenous landscapes where prey availability is a more important factor than vegetation or physiographic components of their perceived landscape (Lloyd 1980, Catling and Burt 1995, Harris and Rayner 1986, Lariviere and Pasitschniak-Arts 1996). The species prefers brushy habitats, avoiding mature hardwoods, during winter in temperate areas (Halpin and Bissonette 1988, Theberge and Wedeles 1989). Various open and semi-open habitats. Usually avoids dense forest, although open woodlands frequently are used. Sometimes occurs in suburban areas or even cities (e.g., in England). May range onto sea ice (Labrador). Maternity dens are in burrows dug by fox or abandoned by other mammals, often in open fields or wooded areas, sometimes under rural buildings, in hollow logs, under stumps, etc. (NatureServe).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nMost common in open woodlands, pasturelands, riparian and agricultural lands. It favors areas with a mixture of those vegetations types occuring in small mosaics with good development of ground cover. In mountains, they occur in montane and subalpine meadows, alpine and forest edges. Usually near water. Occurs in northeastern Arizona, in northern Apache and Navajo counties (Hoffmeister 1986). Red foxes occur only in wooded areas in the northeastern part of this region. Open country is a common element in all of their habitats - from agricultural woodlets interspersed with cropland and grass pastureland to alpine tundra. Found in suitable habitats throughout the region and Rocky Mountain National Park. In our region, it is a chiefly montane species. Red foxes generally prefer areas with a reasonable amount of rainfall and vegetation. Good rodent populations probably play a part in making an area suitable.  The species is common in Utah where it is a primarily found in open and semi-open habitats, although it also occassionally occurs in heavily forested areas, cities, suburban settings (UDWR 2003).  The red fox may be excluded from otherwise preferred habitats when coyotes are present.  Usually avoids dense forest, although open woodlands are frequently used.  Red foxes were introduced from Great Britain/Europe into many parts of the United States and consequently across the states, though there is some evidence to suggest they are native to North America. The Sierra Nevada red fox (V. v. necator) is native and is associated with high elevations. Can be found in the following mountain ranges:Sangre de Cristo Mountains; San Juan Mountains; Jemez Mountains; Mogollon Mountains.\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nRed foxes were probably introduced into the southeatern Unites States prior to 1900 (Kamler and Ballard 2002). In North America, they are native to boreal areas, potentially including the high elevations of the Appalachians (Kamler and Ballard 2002). They tend to use open, upland grassland and srcub areas along forest edges and tend to avoid swamps and hammocks (Layne et al. 1977).They are reported to frequent marsh habitats in southern california and are a threat to nesting birds in these habitats (Harding et al. 2001), however red fox use of coastal marsh habitats in the southeast is not reported. Gosselink et al. (2003) found that red foxes avoided areas used by coyotes and frequented more human habitat types in agriculutral and residential settings. Overall there is little information on fox use of habitats in the Southeast. Rosenblatt (1999) detected red foxes in forest fragments greater than 24 ha. In an agrcultural landscape in Illinois.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mREFOx", "ELCode": "AMAJA03010", "scientific_name": "Vulpes vulpes", "ITIS_TSN": "180604", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105935", "common_name": "Red Fox"}}, "GAP ITIS Information": {"hierarchySoFarWRanks": {"Kingdom": "Animalia", "Family": "Canidae", "Subkingdom": "Bilateria", "Subclass": "Theria", "Order": "Carnivora", "Infraclass": "Eutheria", "Phylum": "Chordata", "Infraphylum": "Gnathostomata", "Superclass": "Tetrapoda", "Suborder": "Caniformia", "Infrakingdom": "Deuterostomia", "Subphylum": "Vertebrata", "Genus": "Vulpes", "Class": "Mammalia", "Species": "Vulpes vulpes"}}}}, {"processing_metadata": {"status": "success", "date_processed": "2019-08-07T15:37:13.338500", "status_message": "Exact Match", "api": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=527d0a83e4b0850ea0518326&format=json&fields=identifiers,files,webLinks,distributionLinks,dates&filter=itemIdentifier%3D{'key': 'Haliaeetus leucocephalus'}"}, "parameters": {"Scientific Name": "Haliaeetus leucocephalus"}, "GAP Species": {"GAP Habitat Map Item": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58fa4517e4b0b7ea54524ca5", "GAP Range Map Item": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59f5ec12e4b063d5d307e3d3", "GAP Habitat Map WMS": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/geoserver/CONUS_HabMap_2001/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities", "GAP Modeling Database Parameters URL": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/58fa4517e4b0b7ea54524ca5?f=__disk__c6%2F7c%2Fed%2Fc67cede4995681a6e5bef08c80c3682c26fe34b3", "GAP ITIS Information URL": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/58fa4517e4b0b7ea54524ca5?f=__disk__86%2Fde%2F11%2F86de11cf20da2babbc47838d9ea3199ba22053de", "GAP Habitat Map File Size": 199302821, "GAP Habitat Map Last Updated": "2019-02-08T13:28:53.869-07:00", "GAP_SpeciesCode": "bBAEAx", "CommonName": "Bald Eagle", "ScientificName": "Haliaeetus leucocephalus", "doi": "doi:10.5066/F7TT4P8Q", "itis_tsn_validMatch": "175420", "nsid_acceptedMatch": "104470", "iucn_id_verified": "22695144", "GAP Range Map WMS": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/geoserver/CONUS_Range_2001/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities", "Range Bounding Box": [-124.82839486487886, 24.688715198042875, -66.9017614483196, 49.384366329079675], "GAP Modeling Database Parameters": {"doi": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7TT4P8Q", "input_layers": {"intEdgeEcoWidth": {"Forest/Open Ecotone Only": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "F/O + Shrubland/Woodland": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7T43RZ7"}, "strAvoid": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "ysnHydroWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strForIntBuffer": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "intFromBuffFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intSlopeMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F75D8QQF", "intIntoBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intElevMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F72N515B", "intSlopeMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F75D8QQF", "PrimEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "AuxEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "hucs": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7DZ0754", "intIntoBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intPercentCanopy": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7DZ0754", "ysnUrbanExclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "intElevMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F72N515B", "Region": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F77H1HGT", "ysnHydroOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "ysnUrbanInclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "strUseForInt": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "intFromBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strStreamVel": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strEdgeType": {"Forest/Open Ecotone Only": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "F/O + Shrubland/Woodland": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7T43RZ7"}, "strSalinity": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "ysnHydroFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intFromBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1"}, "sb_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58fa4517e4b0b7ea54524ca5", "models": {"bBAEAx-w2": {"intPercentCanopy": null, "intIntoBuffFW": 9999.0, "ScientificName": "Haliaeetus leucocephalus", "ysnHydroWV": false, "intAuxBuff": null, "strForIntBuffer": "-500", "intContPatchSize": 10, "ysnHandModel": true, "intSlopeMin": null, "intIntoBuffOW": 1000.0, "Season": "w", "intElevMax": 500, "intSlopeMax": null, "PrimEcoSys": [[3220, "Southern Appalachian Montane Cliff"], [3211, "North Pacific Coastal Cliff and Bluff"], [3110, "Unconsolidated Shore"], [4203, "Southern Crowley's Ridge Mesic Loess Slope Forest"], [4542, "Laurentian Jack Pine-Red Pine Forest"], [8406, "Introduced Riparian and Wetland Vegetation"], [9242, "Laurentian-Acadian Freshwater Marsh"], [9706, "Western Great Plains Depressional Wetland Systems"], [9402, "Great Lakes Wooded Dune and Swale"], [9857, "South-Central Interior Large Floodplain"], [9805, "South-Central Interior Large Floodplain -

Bald eagles prefer areas with horizontal and vertical views and high water-to-land edge (AGFD 2002).    They nest in forests and cliffs along water in areas with high prey availability (i.e. fish, waterfowl, and seabirds; Andrew and Mosher 1982, Green 1985, Campbell et al. 1990), and may be found in the arid western U.S. (Buehler 2000). Most nest in live or dead pine trees (Collopy 1987) but also use cypress, deciduous hardwoods, and mangrove trees (Layne et al. 1977, Kayle 1978, Buehler 2000), and they may nest on the ground in treeless areas (Buehler 2000).  Nests can weigh more than 100 lbs and thus are usually in mature trees (Brown and Amadon 1968).  Normally it is the largest tree, taller than the surrounding stand, providing an easy flight path and open view of the nesting area (Palmer 1988, Johnsgard 1990).   Location of the nest is rarely in deep woods, but is rather along the edge of the forest stand. (Hamel 1992, Palmer 1988).\r\n\r\nBald eagles forage near and over salt and freshwater estuaries, lakes, open marshes, and shorelines (Hamel 1992).  Like the nest tree, roosting and perching trees are among the tallest in the stand (Palmer 1988).  Bald eagle usually have 4 types of perches; 1) Guard Perch- tall trees, cliff and ridge tops and cliff faces, 2) Foraging Perch- adjacent to or overhanging river or lake, 3) Shade Perch, 4) Roost Perch- resting at night, in good view of nest (AGFD 2002).  Sheltered valleys, forested bottomlands, and coniferous trees provide communal roost sites (AGFD 2002).   Along the Columbia River, mature conifer and old-growth forests were selected during low and high tides and bottomland broadleaf trees on river islands were used for hunting perches. High use areas were shoreline habitat with large perch trees that offered an unobstructed view of foraging areas. Tree structure was more important than tree species (Garret et. al. 1993).  Wood (1992) found that marsh, water, and hardwoods habitats were used in proportion to availability in Florida.  Cypress was significantly utilized because of its location along most lake edges (Wood & Collopy 1991).  The top three preferred habitats for perching, flying, and soaring were cypress swamps (19.8%), pinewoods (19.2%), and hardwoods (15.7%). Other commonly used habitats were marshes (14.0%), lakes (11.9%), pastures with trees (9.8%), and pastures/clearcuts (4.0/3.6%) (Wood 1992).  \r\n\r\nThe winter distribution of Bald Eagles is defined by food availability, presence of roost sites that provide protection from inclement weather, and absence of human disturbance (Buehler 2000).  Wintering birds require adequate food supplies such as those usually found in river rapids, impoundments, dam spillways, lakes, and estuaries (AGFD 2002).  They may occur in semideserts and grasslands, especially near prairie dog towns (Andrews and Righter, 1992).  \r\n\r\nNests are commonly in areas within 4km of bodies of water (Andrew and Mosher 1982, Green 1985, Campbell et al. 1990).   Average nest distance to water was 576 m in north Florida and 1.48 km in central Florida.  Most nests are within 3 km of open water greater than 10 ha in size (Collopy 1987; Buehler [2000] reported 2 km).   \r\n\r\nBald Eagles avoid areas with nearby human activity (boat traffic, pedestrians) and development (Buehler et al. 1991).  They show an aversion to nesting within 100 m of human structures but nests are on average > 500 m from structures (Buehler 2000).  \r\n\r\nStinson et al. (2001) found that in Washington State Bald Eagles foraged over water at an average distance of 500 m from the shore (Buehler 2000).  Distances between roost sites and foraging habitat can be great: 29km in Utah, > 10 km in other western states, but < 1 km in NC and VA.  VA roosts in large blocks of forest (Buehler 2000).\r\n\r\nHome range size of resident pairs averaged 22 square km for breeding and nonbreeding periods with a range of 6-47 square km. Core areas averaged 0.1-1.0 square km (Garret et. al. 1993).  \r\n\r\nDuring winter, Bald Eagles typically stay in areas below 500 m in elevation but may reach heights of 2500 m in western states (Beuhler 2000).\r\n\r\nIn Arizona, not an uncommon resident at lakes and streams of the White Mountain region and rarer west to Salt River and Flagstaff; transient in northern mountains and Kaibab Plateau (Phillips et al. 1964).  Winter records in Arizona are mainly from Flagstaff and Colorado River regions; they are rare in the southeast (Phillips et al. 1964).  In Nevada, bald eagles are a winter visitant (Alcorn 1988).  In Colorado, population numbers increase in winter, often seen on plains, western river systems, and mountain parks (Kingery 1998).  They scavenge along reservoir shores and rivers, for fish or crippled waterfowl; may steal fish from Osprey or prairie dogs from Ferruginous hawks (Kingery 1998).  They are uncommon to locally common winter resident in western valleys, in mountain parks, and eastern plains (Andrews and Righter 1992).  N.

They can be found in boreal, coniferous, and deciduous forests, tundra, coastal islands and shorelines, prairies and grasslands, isolated settlements, towns, cities, deserts, and agricultural fields.  They prefer heavily contoured landscapes such as areas with cliffs, trees, or human structures necessary for nesting (Boarman and Heinrich, 1999).  Large numbers may gather at communal roosts in trees, cliff ledges, high-tension power-line towers, and telephone poles (Goodwin 1976, Boarman and Heinrich 1999).  Common Ravens are omnivorous and forage on the ground (Goodwin 1976, Hamel 1992, Kaufman 1996, Potter et al. 1980).\r\n\r\nRavens nest on a variety of substrates including cliffs, highway overpasses and billboards, churches, power poles, oil derricks, railroad trestles, windmills, communication towers, sea cliffs, rock quarries, woodlots, and isolated coniferous trees (Harrison 1975, Potter et al. 1980, Hamel 1992, Boarman and Heinrich 1999).  In Washington, they may avoid areas along rivers when choosing nesting sites, and in Wyoming they prefer forest edges and isolated trees over forest interiors (Boarman and Heinrich 1999).  \r\n\r\nIn the arid southwest, Common Ravens occur in significantly greater numbers in landfills, agricultural fields, and along highways than in open deserts.  They can be found in areas of juniper (Juniperus monosperma), cholla (Opuntia imbricata) and sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) in association with prairie dog towns (Clark et al. 1982).  They are fairly common residents throughout open parts of Arizona wherever nesting cliffs are available (Phillips et al., 1984), and local breeders in the northern part of the lower Colorado River Valley, but become increasingly rare farther south (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  In Colorado, they mainly live in mountains and forests; breeding on cliffs and rocky outcroppings (Kingery 1998).  They are widespread over the entire state of Nevada (Alcorn 1988).  In New Mexico, they occur in most of the wooded foothills and forested mountains of the state that are over 1,524 m (Ligon 1961).\r\n\r\nIn the Southeast, Common Ravens are found at high elevations, usually above 3,000 ft, and they breed in mountainous areas where cliffs or rocky crags are present for nesting (Hamel 1992, Simpson 1992).  They frequently forage in open woods, margins, and fields at high elevations, as well as campgrounds, picnic areas, dumps, and other places with garbage (Hamel 1992).   N.

Nests individually or semi-colonially in remote areas, preferring sites that command a clear view in all directions with permanent water not far away, including lakes, ponds, larger streams, marshes, muskegs, and wet hummocky areas (NatureServe 2010, Mowbray et al. 2002). Canada geese tend to use wooded or scrubby islands in marshes and rivers, but also muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) houses, floating mats of reeds and even elevated platforms and abandoned nests of birds of prey (Mowbray et al. 2002). In southern part of range, prefers marshes, especially those with hardstem bulrush (Scirpus acutus) or cattail (Typha spp.) with muskrat houses and feeding platforms, but also nests in meadows and on gravel bars and islands of inland lakes and the sea. Also breeds successfully in agricultural and urban areas in southern part of its breeding range; in agricultural fields, near irrigation ditches, reservoirs, sewage lagoons, city lakes and parks, golf courses, lawn-rich subdivisions, highway medians, and on tops of city buildings (Mowbray et al. 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bCANGx", "ELCode": "ABNJB05030", "scientific_name": "Branta

In general, its habitat covers tropical and subtropical waters, in protected, shallow, marine and estuarine waters, including bays and lagoons (NMFS and USFWS 2007). \r\n\r\nIt burrows in or using sand from dunes. Nesting is highly synchronized in some areas having 100s to 10,000s of females may emerge and nest within a period of a few hours or days while solitary nesting also occurs. In the eastern Pacific, synchronized nesting occurs annually at several beaches in Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama from June through December; during the same period, ridleys emerge to nest solitarily along the entire coast from Mexico to Colombia (NMFS and USFWS 2007). Nesting occurs on upper beaches while individuals sometimes change to a different nesting beach within a single nesting season (Eckert et al. 1989).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rORSTx", "ELCode": "ARAAA04020", "scientific_name": "Lepidochelys olivacea", "ITIS_TSN": "173840", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106179", "common_name": "Olive Ridley Sea Turtle"}}, "GAP ITIS Information": {"hierarchySoFarWRanks": {"Kingdom": "Animalia", "Superfamily": "Chelonioidea", "Genus": "Lepidochelys", "Family": "Cheloniidae", "Subkingdom": "Bilateria", "Order": "Testudines", "Phylum": "Chordata", "Infraphylum": "Gnathostomata", "Superclass": "Tetrapoda", "Suborder": "Cryptodira", "Infrakingdom": "Deuterostomia", "Subphylum": "Vertebrata", "Subfamily": "Carettinae", "Class": "Reptilia", "Species": "Lepidochelys olivacea"}}}}, {"processing_metadata": {"status": "success", "date_processed": "2019-08-07T15:37:13.338500", "status_message": "Exact Match", "api": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=527d0a83e4b0850ea0518326&format=json&fields=identifiers,files,webLinks,distributionLinks,dates&filter=itemIdentifier%3D{'key': 'Reithrodontomys megalotis'}"}, "parameters": {"Scientific Name": "Reithrodontomys megalotis"}, "GAP Species": {"GAP Habitat Map Item": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58fa7fb7e4b0b7ea54525bf9", "GAP Range Map Item": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59f5ec20e4b063d5d307e461", "GAP Habitat Map WMS": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/geoserver/CONUS_HabMap_2001/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities", "GAP Modeling Database Parameters URL": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/58fa7fb7e4b0b7ea54525bf9?f=__disk__c2%2F91%2Fb4%2Fc291b453225d5d746953c0a25f0c6e9e5aae1609", "GAP ITIS Information URL": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/58fa7fb7e4b0b7ea54525bf9?f=__disk__52%2F10%2Fd8%2F5210d87b2c2983f2e0fa285c18dc18e9c0c369ce", "GAP Habitat Map File Size": 284754208, "GAP Habitat Map Last Updated": "2019-02-08T13:32:07.329-07:00", "GAP_SpeciesCode": "mWHMOx", "CommonName": "Western Harvest Mouse", "ScientificName": "Reithrodontomys megalotis", "doi": "doi:10.5066/F73X8539", "itis_tsn_validMatch": "180343", "nsid_acceptedMatch": "105306", "iucn_id_verified": "19410", "GAP Range Map WMS": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/geoserver/CONUS_Range_2001/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities", "Range Bounding Box": [-124.47443078528048, 28.971550917166326, -86.87535267888919, 49.00029539849896], "GAP Modeling Database Parameters": {"doi": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F73X8539", "input_layers": {"intEdgeEcoWidth": {"Forest/Open Ecotone Only": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "F/O + Shrubland/Woodland": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7T43RZ7"}, "strAvoid": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "ysnHydroWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strForIntBuffer": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "intFromBuffFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intSlopeMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F75D8QQF", "intIntoBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intElevMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F72N515B", "intSlopeMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F75D8QQF", "PrimEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "AuxEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "hucs": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7DZ0754", "intIntoBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intPercentCanopy": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7DZ0754", "ysnUrbanExclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "intElevMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F72N515B", "Region": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F77H1HGT", "ysnHydroOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "ysnUrbanInclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "strUseForInt": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "intFromBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strStreamVel": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strEdgeType": {"Forest/Open Ecotone Only": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "F/O + Shrubland/Woodland": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7T43RZ7"}, "strSalinity": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "ysnHydroFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intFromBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1"}, "sb_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58fa7fb7e4b0b7ea54525bf9", "models": {"mWHMOx-y2": {"intPercentCanopy": null, "intIntoBuffFW": null, "ScientificName": "Reithrodontomys megalotis", "ysnHydroWV": false, "intAuxBuff": 60.0, "strForIntBuffer": null, "intContPatchSize": null, "ysnHandModel": false, "intSlopeMin": null, "intIntoBuffOW": null, "Season": "y", "intElevMax": 4000, "intSlopeMax": null, "PrimEcoSys": [[9857, "South-Central Interior Large Floodplain"], [9818, "Central Interior and Appalachian Floodplain Systems"], [9819, "Central Interior and Appalachian Riparian Systems"], [9212, "Central Interior and Appalachian Swamp Systems"], [8503, "Ruderal Upland -

PNV - mixed \"shortgrass\" and Great Basin desertscrub (Thompson 1996).  In NM it occurs everywhere except \"well-developed\" mixed coniferous and spruce fir communities in San Juan, Jemez, and Sangre de Christo Mountains (Thompson et al. 1996).  R. Megalotis is found in the Mogollons in a meadow surrounded by spruce fir (Thompson et al. 1996).  It should be found in all mountains in New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  Grasses are the preferred cover, and since they are more plentiful in moist areas the mouse is usually found there (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It is found among cottonwood, willow, pinyon-juniper, western live oak, limber pine, white fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, Chihuahuan pine, Apache pine, bristle-cone pine, bristlecone pine, border pinyon, alligator juniper, gray oak, emory oak, Gambel's oak, Toumey's oak, sand sage, winter-fat, creosotebush, tarbush, ocotillo, yucca, tumbleweed, mesquite, cocklebur, fir, aspen, bracken, broom snakeweed, rubber rabbitbrush, spiny greasebush, fourwing saltbush, redberry juniper, silverleaf and netleaf oaks, shinnery oak scrub, sedges, cattails, muhly, fescue, grama and buffalograss, galleta and ricegrass, big bluestem, sand bluestem, alkali sacaton, tobosa, alder, Apache plume, sunflowers, grain, alfalfa, shortgrass-sacahuiste, and greasebush (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  One was taken next to a rock adjacent to a Ribes thicket (Hoffmeister et al. 1954).  It eats mainly seeds from grasses, legumes, and mustards (Zeveloff 1988).  Elevation is between -77m in Death Valley, California and 4,000m in Mexico (Webster and Jones, Jr. 1982). Individuals show movements of 200-300ft in a live-trap grid and a homing ability of 1,000ft (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). The home range is 0.2ha (NatureServe 2003).  The species occurs throughout Arizona except in much of the Mojave and Sonoran desertscrub and the montane Mogollon Plateau (Hoffmeister 1986).  The mouse occurs in the San Luis Valley, valleys of the Western Slope, and the eastern plains of Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It occurs throughout Nevada (Hall 1995). The species occurs throughout New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). R. megalotis is found everywhere in Utah except the northeast (Durrant 1952, Utah GAP 1997).\r\nIn California, R. megaltis is distributed throughout the state including the Channel and Catalina Islands although it is absent from higher elevations. The species is common to abundant in shrublands, grasslands, and early seral stages of many forested habitats preferring thick grass and shrub cover for foraging and nesting (Brylski et al. [CAWHR 2005] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn Oregon, the western harvest mouse is found east of the Cascade Mts. With the exception of the southern part of the state in the Siskiyou-Klamath regions and is absent from the Blue and Wallowa Mts. In the northeast (Verts and Carraway 1998). It inhabits grassy and shrubby vegetation including sagebrush, marsh, meadows, grazed marsh, bitter-brush, rabbit-brush, cottonwood, and willow (Verts and Carraway 1998).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, Schmidly (2004) describes habitat as \"favors grassy and weedy habitats such as lightly razed pastures, meadows, fencerows, fallow fields, and edge habitats between agricultural and riparian areas. Meadows, marshes, and weed-covered banks of irrigation ditches seem to offer optimum habitat conditions. The species seldom is found in forested areas. In the Big Bend area it has been taken in grasslands, riparian, and desert scrub situations. On the Llano Estacado it prefers grassy, weedy, brushy rencewrows and highway rights-of-way\".", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mWHMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF02030", "scientific_name": "Reithrodontomys

They are most abundant in grasslands, less abundant in dense coniferous fores. Found almost everywhere in the NV, NM, AZ, CO, UT. Coyotes survive in a diversity of environments and recently have become common in many urban areas. Throughout New Mexico, from the deserts and desert slopes to spruce fir of higher mountains. Broken country, interrupted by rocks, brush, clumps of pinyon juniper or other vegetation, makes excellent habitat for coyotes. The species is often found in close proximity to farms, ranches, and suburan areas. Most common in grasslands, are found in all habitats in New Mexico. Coyotes occur from high mountains to low deserts.  They are often common on rangelands and in the suburbs of towns and cities.  Coyotes occur at all elevations and in all ecosystems (Fitzgerald et al 1994).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn Oregon, this species occurs in habitats ranging from grasslands to shrub-steppe to boreal forests and within remote wilderness or urbanized areas (Voigt and Berg 1987). Young (1951) considered the coyote and edge species because it had (at that time) extended its range to regions such as northwestern Oregon where broad expanses of mature forest had been removed through logging or fire (Verts and Carraway 1998).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nPerhaps introduced by fox hunters or arrived as the result of natural eastward expansion from its western and central North America range, the coyote is now believed to be well established in most eastern states (Lee et al. 1982).  Coyotes are habitat generalists and feed on meso and small mammals, reptiles,  birds and small livestock; they also scavenge.  They are limited by food availability as opposed to habita type.  However they do respond to human landscape features.  Home ranges are smaller in urban areas and movement rates are much lower compared to rural areas.  They tended to avoid urban areas and agricultural fields  (Atwood et al. 2004).  The coyote is capable of inhabiting any area perhaps with the exception of areas densely populated by humans (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  Will inhabit a wide range of habitats from open to forested conditions. However, they appear to be most suited to scrub country, fragmented forest and landscapes with a diversity of habitats (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). In Georgia, coyotes demonstrated habitat selection only during night hours. Brushy areas, young pine, pine/hardwoods, bottomland hardwoods receive most use (ranking 1 to 3 respectively) were used more than expected during nocturnal hours; pastures, agricultural, mature pine plantations were used less (Holzman et al 1992). In Texas habitats were used that  supported the highest prey densitites. Preferred habitats were savannah and prairie creeks. High prey densities, abundant fruit, and the opportunistic feeding strategy of coyotes apparently minimized habitat selection (Bradley & Fagre 1988).  Prefer open rangeland, fallow fields, and brushy pastures.  Least common in deep forest areas (Brown 1997).  Giordano and Pace (2000) studied coyotes in a marsh system in Louisiana.  They den in swamps as well.\r\nDenning and young rearing typically occurs in a subterranean chamber located in a brushy-thicketed area, in a ravine or gully, or among rocks and boulders (Webster et al. 1985, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Woodlands and agricultural areas were used more than expected by transient coyotes, whereas grasslands were used more than expected by family groups in Kansas (Kamler and Gipson 2000).\r\nIn Maine, mean home range was 46.4 square km  and dispersal of 300+ km documented (Harrison et al 1989).  The average dispersal distance was 102 km (Harrison 1992). In Vermont, the mean home range was 16.4 square km using the convex polygon, 17.7  square km using the harmonic mean.  In Yellowstone, the mean recovery distance of 102 females was 11.1 miles and of 110 males was 7.9 miles. The maximum distance travelled was by a female with pups for 115 airline miles (Robinson & Grand).  In Texas, using radio telemetry, the mean home range size of resident individuals was 3.04 square km. For males the mean home range was 3.07 +/- 0.77 sqare km, for females the mean home range was 3.01 +/- 0.22 square km. One adult male dispersed 3 km. One adult female dispersed 13 km. In Georgia average female home range size was 34 km2 and adult male average home range size was not reported. Juvenile males in Georgia had home ranges sizes averaging 5.9 km2 (Holzman 1992).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCOYOx", "ELCode": "AMAJA01010", "scientific_name": "Canis latrans", "ITIS_TSN": "180599", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102680", "common_name": "Coyote"}}, "GAP ITIS Information": {"hierarchySoFarWRanks": {"Kingdom": "Animalia", "Family": "Canidae", "Subkingdom": "Bilateria", "Subclass": "Theria", "Order": "Carnivora", "Infraclass": "Eutheria", "Phylum": "Chordata", "Infraphylum": "Gnathostomata", "Superclass": "Tetrapoda", "Suborder": "Caniformia", "Infrakingdom": "Deuterostomia", "Subphylum": "Vertebrata", "Genus": "Canis", "Class": "Mammalia", "Species": "Canis latrans"}}}}, {"processing_metadata": {"status": "success", "date_processed": "2019-08-07T15:37:13.338500", "status_message": "Exact Match", "api": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=527d0a83e4b0850ea0518326&format=json&fields=identifiers,files,webLinks,distributionLinks,dates&filter=itemIdentifier%3D{'key': 'Lanius ludovicianus'}"}, "parameters": {"Scientific Name": "Lanius ludovicianus"}, "GAP Species": {"GAP Habitat Map Item": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58fa4f87e4b0b7ea54525180", "GAP Range Map Item": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59f5e238e4b063d5d307dd4f", "GAP Habitat Map WMS": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/geoserver/CONUS_HabMap_2001/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities", "GAP Modeling Database Parameters URL": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/58fa4f87e4b0b7ea54525180?f=__disk__09%2F38%2F25%2F093825c51a479767dd0aeaa1cac9ae743fc263d3", "GAP ITIS Information URL": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/58fa4f87e4b0b7ea54525180?f=__disk__c8%2F31%2Fe1%2Fc831e14051ec1d480579813d870805c6d1b08924", "GAP Habitat Map File Size": 508223124, "GAP Habitat Map Last Updated": "2019-02-08T12:22:05.490-07:00", "GAP_SpeciesCode": "bLOSHx", "CommonName": "Loggerhead Shrike", "ScientificName": "Lanius ludovicianus", "doi": "doi:10.5066/F789145G", "itis_tsn_validMatch": "178515", "nsid_acceptedMatch": "104527", "iucn_id_verified": "22705042", "GAP Range Map WMS": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/geoserver/CONUS_Range_2001/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities", "Range Bounding Box": [-124.47421553187041, 24.46461544829042, -71.72313198168564, 49.384366329079675], "GAP Modeling Database Parameters": {"doi": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F789145G", "input_layers": {"intEdgeEcoWidth": {"Forest/Open Ecotone Only": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "F/O + Shrubland/Woodland": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7T43RZ7"}, "strAvoid": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "ysnHydroWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strForIntBuffer": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "intFromBuffFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intSlopeMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F75D8QQF", "intIntoBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intElevMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F72N515B", "intSlopeMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F75D8QQF", "PrimEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "AuxEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "hucs": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7DZ0754", "intIntoBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intPercentCanopy": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7DZ0754", "ysnUrbanExclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "intElevMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F72N515B", "Region": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F77H1HGT", "ysnHydroOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "ysnUrbanInclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "strUseForInt": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "intFromBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strStreamVel": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strEdgeType": {"Forest/Open Ecotone Only": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "F/O + Shrubland/Woodland": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7T43RZ7"}, "strSalinity": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "ysnHydroFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intFromBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1"}, "sb_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58fa4f87e4b0b7ea54525180", "models": {"bLOSHx-s5": {"intPercentCanopy": null, "intIntoBuffFW": null, "ScientificName": "Lanius ludovicianus", "ysnHydroWV": false, "intAuxBuff": null, "strForIntBuffer": null, "intContPatchSize": 52, "ysnHandModel": false, "intSlopeMin": null, "intIntoBuffOW": null, "Season": "s", "intElevMax": null, "intSlopeMax": null, "PrimEcoSys": [[9840, "West Gulf Coastal Plain Large River Floodplain Forest"], [9826, "Northwestern Great Plains Floodplain"], [4141, "East-Central Texas Plains Riparian Forest"], [7317, "Southeastern Great Plains Tallgrass Prairie"], [7323, "Tamaulipan Clay Grassland"], [7505, "Texas-Louisiana Coastal Prairie"], [9604, "Texas Saline Coastal Prairie"], [8406, "Introduced Riparian and Wetland Vegetation"], [9823, "Western Great Plains Floodplain"], [8503, "Ruderal Upland -

Breeders usually settle near isolated trees or large shrubs and often perch on poles, wires or fence posts. This species nests in shrubs, small trees or vine covered plants (Yosef 1996, NatureServe 2010). Suitable hunting perches are an important part of the habitat (NatureServe 2010). Resident Loggerhead Shrikes use the same habitat all year. In many regions, loggerhead shrike abundance correlate with percentage of pastureland available (Yosef 1996). B.

They are found in mature hardwood & mixed conifer-hardwood forests, including in urban and rural areas, and they will also use old orchards.  In south Florida, they also use pinelands, hammock, swamp, coastal shrub, and bayhead (Fernald 1989; Layne 1984; Moore 1947).  They primarily nest in tree cavities, but will use birdhouses, attics, and abandoned leaf nests. Burt (1940) found that flying squirrels ranged over 3.72 acres of a wood plot.

The species requires high visibility (Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985; Wakelyn, 1987; Demarchi et al., 2000; Demarchi, 2004; Beecham et al., 2007), therefore structure plays a more direct role in habitat selection than composition (Beecham et al., 2007). Demarchi (2004) quantified bighorn sheeps\u2019 structure/visibility requirements, indicating a minimum 55% visibility at a distance of 14 m in all directions, at a height of 90 cm above the ground. Due to this restriction, the species rarely uses forest or dense woodland (Tilton and Willard, 1982; Demarchi et al., 2000; Beecham et al., 2007), though use of forest edge, open forest, woodlands\u2014particularly by rams and during winter\u2014is well documented (Oldemeyer et al., 1971; Demarchi and Mitchell, 1973; Tilton and Willard, 1982; Demarchi et al., 2000; Beecham et al., 2007). Similarly, the species avoids: dense shrublands (Van Dyke, 1978; Holl, 1982; Locke, 2003); \u201cdoghair\u201d forest regeneration (Brundige and McCabe, 1986; Layne, 1987); and riparian areas (Van Dyke, 1978; Tilton and Willad, 1982; Smith, 1985; Brundige and McCabe, 1986; Layne, 1987). Holl (1982) defined the species\u2019 maximum shrub cover threshold as 30%.\r\n\r\nHabitats used by the bighorn sheep include: talus and rock outcrops (Van Dyke, 1978; Tilton and Willard, 1982; Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985; Demarchi et al., 2000; Beecham et al., 2007); alpine tundra (Johnson, 1980; Demarchi et al., 2000); grass/forb patches and meadows (Oldemeyer et al., 1971; Demarchi and Mitchell, 1973; Van Dyke, 1978; Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985; Layne, 1987; Demarchi et al., 2000; Beecham et al., 2007); krummholz (Johnson, 1980; Demarchi et al., 2000); subalpine woodlands (Johnson, 1980); pinyon-juniper woodlands (Greenwood et al., 1999; Smith et al., 1999); ponderosa pine savanna and open woodlands (Layne, 1987; Smith et al., 1989; Brundige and McCabe, 1986); open desert shrubland, such as those dominated by ocotillo and brittle-bush (Krausman et al., 1989); Mojave desert shrub (Smith, 1985); open mountain shrubs (Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985); shrub steppe (Tilton and Willard, 1982; Beecham et al., 2007); and burned shrubland or forest, where few snags remain (Etchberger et al., 1991; Greenwood et al., 1999; Smith et al., 1999). Habitats specifically avoided by the bighorn sheep include: roads and other developed areas (Demarchi, 2004; Bleich et al., 2008); dense shrubland (Van Dyke, 1978; Smith, 1985; Smith et al., 1999; Locke, 2003); forest (Van Dyke, 1978; Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985); and woodlands with depauperate understories (Layne, 1987).\r\n\r\nThat the bighorn sheep\u2019s distribution is restricted to areas near escape terrain is undisputed; however, both the definition of escape terrain and the species\u2019 proximity restrictions are defined differently across studies. Escape terrain has been defined with minimum slopes ranging from 20% (USFWS, 2000) to 200% (Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985). Bighorn sheep\u2019s maximum distance to escape terrain has been documented as ranging from 80 m (Brundige and McCabe, 1986) to 800 m (USFWS, 2000). Across a number of studies, the median documented minimum slope for escape terrain was 60%, with a mean of 77%; the median documented maximum distance from escape terrain was 300 m, with a mean of 281 m (Oldemeyer et al., 1971; Tilton and Willard, 1982; Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985; Brundige and McCabe, 1986; Layne, 1987; Wakelyn, 1987; Arnett, 1990; Smith, 1992; Dunn, 1996; Jalkotzy, 2000; McKinney et al., 2003; Demarchi, 2004; IDFG, 2010). Some authors have defined additional restrictions on the definition of escape terrain, such as only rocky substrates (Brundige and McCabe, 1986; Beecham et al., 2007) and minimum patch sizes (Tilton, 1977; Armentrout and Brigham, 1988; McKinney et al., 2003). Suggested minimum patch sizes range from 1.6 to 2 km.\r\n\r\n\u201cEscape terrain\u201d is an arbitrary concept, reflecting the bighorn sheep\u2019s general preference for higher slopes. When outside of what is classified as escape terrain, the sheep still are more likely to be found on steeper slopes (Tilton and Willard, 1982; Bristow, 1997; Locke, 2003; Bangs et al., 2005; Beecham et al., 2007; Bleich et al., 2008) and are rarely found on slopes <10% (Tilton and Willard, 1982; Smith, 1985; Beecham et al., 2007).\r\n\r\nIn the conterminous U.S., bighorn sheep have been documented from elevations below sea level (Welles and Welles, 1961) to 4300 m (Beecham et al., 2007).\r\n\r\nWhile some suggest that the species is restricted by proximity to water (Demarchi, 2004; Bleich et al., 2010), others have documented occurrences up to 16 km from open water (USFWS, 2000), and others have found the species to occur farther from water than random points in the study area (Bleich et al., 2008) or have found no signification association with water (Bristow, 1997; Cain, 2006).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mBISHx", "ELCode": "AMALE04010", "scientific_name": "Ovis

Other shrubs found within pygmy rabbit habitat include greasewood (Green and Flinders, 1980a), antelope bitterbrush (Green and Flinders, 1980b), and rabbitbrush (Heady et al., 2001). Specifically, the species is found in areas with greater cover of sagebrush (Weiss and Verts, 1984). For example, Green and Flinders (1980b) observed a mean shrub cover of 46% in sites occupied by pygmy rabbit, versus a mean of 29% for sites from which they were absent. Similarly, Katzner and Parker (1997) observed a mean shrub cover of 43% at occupied sites and 17% at unoccupied sites. Hagar and Lienkaemper (2007) defined shrub cover >40% as suitable for the species, with shrub cover >20% and <40% providing marginal habitat. Likewise, shrub height is another indicator of habitat suitability (Weiss and Verts, 1984), with observed mean shrub heights at occupied sites ranging from 52 cm (Katzner and Parker, 1997) to 86 cm (Hagar and Lienkaemper, 2007), versus unoccupied sites with mean shrubs heights ranging from 25 cm (Green and Flinders, 1980b) to 58 cm (Hagar and Lienkaemper, 2007). Note that though Weiss and Verts (1984) report significantly different values for the species\u2019 shrub cover preferences, their cover calculation methodology was different from those used in other studies. The species avoids recently burned sites, where 13-27 years of growth is required for sufficient vegetative structure to be restored (Woods et al., 2013). Finally, due to the pygmy rabbits\u2019 tendency to burrow as a juvenile (Green and Flinders, 1980a), soil type/depth is another factor that limits its distribution; the species\u2019 has an affinity for deep, sandy loams (Weiss and Verts, 1984; Heady et al., 2001; Hagar and Lienkaemper, 2007; Larrucea and Brussard, 2008).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mPYRAx", "ELCode": "AMAEB04010",

In 1985, it was reintroduced in Buenos Aries Wildlife Refuge in the Alter Valley in southern Arizona (Arizona Game and Fish Department 2001). \r\n\r\nThe Bobwhite is associated with a variety of early-successional stage habitats, such as what exists in agricultural areas, brushy pastures, grassy roadsides, grasslands, open park-like mixed deciduous and pine woodlands and savannas, grass-brush rangelands (Brennan 1999), overgrown fields, native prairies, woodland edges (Fussell 1994), and gaps made in the forest by logging (Stupka 1963).  In Tennessee, they are most abundant in a mosaic of agricultural fields, wooded hedgerows, and fallow fields dominated by broom sedge (Nicholson 1997).

(2005) located nests in fallow fields, open-canopy planted pine stands, young pine plantations, and pine-plantations that were >7 yr old and had been row-thinned.  None were found in hardwood stands >5 yrs old.  All of the nests that they found in closed-canopy pine stands were <25 m from the stand\u2019s edge.  Guthery et al. (2001) examined Bobwhite habitat in an Oklahoma landscape and found brushy prairie and early-successional woodlands to be beneficial while mature woodlands were detrimental to Bobwhite populations.\r\n\r\nIn general, Bobwhite habitat is characterized by an open canopy or grassland with the presence of grasses, forbs, shrubs, and intermittent small patches of bare ground among stems and clumps of herbaceous vegetation (Brennan 1999, White et al. 2005).  Their abundance and nest site selection are influenced at the landscape scale by landscape composition (percent of landcover types) and landscape configuration (patch diversity; White et al. 2005).  The landscapes historically created by agriculture, a patchwork of croplands, fallow fields, hardwood forests, and pine plantations, were beneficial to the Bobwhite because of its preference for early-successional habitats and ecotones (Brennan 1999, Gutherey et al. 2001, White et al. 2005).  Modern agriculture has trended towards larger, \u201ccleaner\u201d fields without these features, which has been implicated in large scale population declines (Brennan 1999).  Although the agricultural landscapes that preceded intensive farming methods were beneficial to Bobwhites, they were not required; natural habitat types alone can host high densities of Bobwhites (Guthery et al. 2001).  \r\n\r\nWithin woodlands, Bobwhites utilize early successional conditions that are created by disturbance events such as fires, logging, and agriculture (Brennan 1999). In southern pine forests, frequent (1-3 yr intervals) fires are necessary to maintain the open conditions needed by Bobwhites (Brennan 1999).  They are commonly found in pine woodlands with well developed grass ground cover and little or no midstory, such as longleaf-slash, loblolly-shortleaf in the Atlantic Coastal Plain and Piedmont and virginia pine, shortleaf pine in the Ridge and Valley, Highland Rim, Cumberland Plateau and Peidmont (Hunter 1990).  Bobwhite are typically absent from high-density pine plantations (Brennan 1999).  Well-drained upland pine and mixed deciduous woodlands with <50% canopy cover offer the \u201cbest opportunities for bobwhite management\u201d (Brennan 1999). \r\n\r\nBobwhite also exist in rangelands landscapes that are not dominated by forests or woodlands.  Some strong Bobwhite populations occur in north Texas, south Texas, and Oklahoma in rangeland habitats where agriculture is absent (Guthery et al. 2001).  They are also found in Cross Timbers forests, tallgrass prairies, sandsage-grasslands, and brushy prairies (Guthery et al. 2001).  Open grasslands in the West can be suitable if they are mixed with small shrubs, thorny bushes, or trees (Brennan 1999).  In rangelands, they exist in early and late successional stage habitats and they benefit from light cattle grazing (Brennan 1999).  Brushy draws, fencerows, and woodlots are also used in the Midwest and Great Plains. \r\n\r\nBobwhites place nests in woodlands or fields (Harrison 1975), usually within 15-20 m of an opening such as a field or road.  The nest is located on ground that is partially covered with standing vegetation <45 cm tall (Brennan 1999) and placed in a tuft of dead or living grass with surrounding herbaceous plants covering it and often woven into an arch above it (Harrison 1975).  After their eggs hatch, the parents lead the fledgling to habitat that is more open than where nest was placed.  These brood habitats can be over 500 m from the nest.\r\n\r\nThe elevation range within which Bobwhite are found in New Mexico and Arizona is 942-1,830m (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2001). \r\n\r\nN.

Elk in Michigan thrive in a mixed open and woodland environment. In summer they occupy areas of aspen/hardwood forest broken up by numerous openings. In winter they inhabit swampy areas with conifers, cutover areas, aspen/hardwoods, and upland conifer/hardwoods with openings\" (Whitaker 1998). Elk reintroduced to Kentucky occupy forest landscapes with large openings such as those created by mine reclaimation. They primarily use forested ridgetops, upper sideslopes, grassy openings, and shrubby edges of floodplains (Trani et al. 2007).\r\n\r\nNortheast:\r\nElk in Pennsylvania occupy forested landscapes of the Allegheny Plateau at elevations between 900 and 2300 feet (274 - 701 m). This area is a south-north transition zone between mixed oak-hickory and northern hardwood deciduous forests (Cogan and Diefenbach 1998, O'Gara and Dundas 2002).\r\n\r\nSouthwest/Northwest:\r\nCommon in most mountainous regions of Utah. Found in mountain meadows and forests during the summer and in foothills and valley grasslands during winter. They avoid deep snow.  Associated with semiopen forests or forest edges adjacent to parks, meadows, alpine tundra. In Colorado, the species ranges throughout the western two-thirds of state generally at elevations above 1800 m. Habitat: semiopen forest, mountain meadows, foothills, plains, valleys. Uses open areas such as alpine pastures, marshy meadows, river flats, aspen parkland, coniferous forest, brushy clear cuts, forest edges, and semi-desert areas. Elk in non-roaded habitats increased use of open timber types; in roaded habitat, they increased use of closed canopy timbered types. Begin moving down to exposed southern slopes at lower elevations when deepening snow piles up to about 20 inches (500 mm). At the present time, elk do well in Arizona in the mountainous areas that have extensive stands of forest. Small, isolated mountain ranges, with limited coniferous forest, do not provide good areas for elk.\r\nIn California, Tule Elk (Cervus elaphus nannodes) introduced to the Owens Valley use brush, scrub and herbaceous habitats year-round (McCullough 1969, [Alhorn et al. in CAWHR] based on Zeiner et al. 1990). In other parts of the state, C. e. roosevelti and C. e. nelsoni utilize open, brushy stands of deciduous and coniferous habitats (both forest and woodlands) as well as riparian areas, meadows, and herbaceous early successional forest environments ([Alhorn et al. in CAWHR] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\nIn Oregon, elk are most abundant in the Blue and Wallowa mountains and northern coast range while being less abundant in the arid southeastern regions. Habitat is a mosaic of early succesional stages with abundant herbaceous forage, and later successional forested habitats that provide cover. In the western part of the state, early successional foraging habitats are most often provided by clearcut and burned forest stands (Verts and Carraway 1998). In the Blue Mountains, Leckenby (1984) found that >80% of foraging habitat for elk consisted of a forest/open ecotone 600 yards (550 m) wide. Ecotones of forest/woodland and early successional and shrub habitats are very important landscape features of high quality elk habitat (Skovlin et al. 2002). In general, habitat management guidelines for elk recommend maintaining landscapes that provide 40% cover and 60% forage consisting of tall shrub, woodland, and forested habitat; and open spaces of low shrub and herbaceous vegetation respectively (Skovlin et al. 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mELK1x", "ELCode": "AMALC01010", "scientific_name": "Cervus elaphus", "ITIS_TSN": "180695",

The taxonomy of this species is uncertain, however, and may actually include populations that warrant species status.  Numerous subspecies are currently recognized and have more restrictive habitat needs than the species as a whole.  Some are described below.\r\n\r\nDeer Mice use a wide variety of upland and riparian habitats from open areas and brushlands to coniferous and deciduous forests. The range of this species extends southward from general forested habitats in the northeastern United States and Canada to the southeastern limit of its breeding range in the southern Appalachians, where, in North Carolina, it occurs on mountain slopes and peaks and in some foothill locations (Lee et al. 1982, Brown 1997).\r\n\r\nWithin the southern Appalachian region, the species is largely associated with cool, moist mixed conifer and deciduous forests or conifer forests (Brown 1997, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998), and also with deciduous forests which contain evergreen shrub thickets (Webster et al. 1985). Rocky, mossy conditions or areas with numerous downed and decaying logs and stumps are favorable nesting and denning sites (Webster et al. 1985).\r\n\r\nP. m. bairdii prefers open weedfield, abandoned cropland, grasslands, sandy areas and any place cleared of trees (Barbour & Davis 1974, Whitaker & Hamilton 1998).  P.m. nubiterrae uses woodland, mixed woods, conifers, hardwoods. It is found in all habitats in higher mountian elevation and restricted to dense forests of birch, beech, and maple where forest floor stays cool and moist - farther down mountians (Barbout & Davis 1974).  \r\n\r\nIn the Southwest, P. maniculatus occurs in tundra, Rocky Mountain alpine and subalpine grassland, plains grassland, open, sparsely vegetated deserts, warm temperate swamp and riparian forests, and Sonoran desertscrub (Thompson et al. 1996, Davis and Schmidly 1997). PNV (BLM) - Shortgrass prairies, sactan grassland, and sycamore and rabbitbrush riparian (Thompson et al. 1996). The species is most common in ponderosa, mixed coniferous, and spruce - fir forests; next most common in northern sage-grassland; and much less common in woodland, grassland, and desert communities (Thompson et al. 1996). In more southern areas, the species may inhabit sandy areas with P. leucopus (Thompson et al. 1996). In southern New Mexico, the indigenous species of Peromyscus in the woodland zone act as a barrier between the montane and lowland populations of P. maniculatus (Thompson et al. 1996).  In Colorado, it is found in all habitats with cover, except well-developed wetlands (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It avoids poorly drained soils (Thompson et al. 1996). It occurs in most habitats at all elevations in Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). P. maniculatus exploits disturbed habitats: overgrazed, cleared, mined, construction sites, burned, and avalanche or landslide areas (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It should be found in all the mountains of New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  P. maniculatus occurs among aspen, cottonwood - willow, pinyon - juniper, bristlecone pine, limber pine, Chihuahuan pine, Apache pine, Gambel's oak, Toumey's oak, broom snakeweed, fourwing saltbush, saltcedar, Russian olive, crested wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, sixweeks fescue, Indian ricegrass, sand sage, winter-fat, creosote, tarbush, ocotillo, redberry juniper, silverleaf and netleaf oaks, shinnery oak scrub, sedges, grama and buffalograss, galleta, big bluestem, sand bluestem, alkali sacaton, tobosa, bluejoint, ricegrass, alder, Apache plume, mesquite, rushes, cattails, three-awn-finger grass, bluejoint - switchgrass, sand plum thickets, saltcedar - groundsel tree, yucca, beargrass, allthorn, ephedra, and ribes (Thompson et al. 1996).  It eats almost anything - seeds, carrion, bone, fungi, leaves, and bark (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  \r\n\r\nThe home range is 0.2ha (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). The elevation is 305-3963m (Thompson et al. 1996).  P. maniculatus occurs throughout the southwest (Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Hall 1995, Utah GAP 1997, Frey 2004). Can be found in the following mountain ranges: Ruby Mountains; Sulpher Spring Range; Snake Mountains; Animas Mountains; San Andres Mountains; Pinaleno Mountains; Manzano Mountains; Hualapai Mountains; Chuska Mountains; Tunitcha Mountains; White Mountains; Lukachukai Mountains; Juniper Mountains; Gila Mountains; Blue Range; Santa Catalina Mountains, Chirichua Mountains; Huachuca Mountains; Mohave Mountains; Santa Rita Mountains; Pinr Forest Range; Gramite Range (Washoe); Fox Range; Carson Range; Cambridge Hills; Kamma Mountains; Excelsior Mountains; Silver Peak Range; Cartez Mountains; Palmetto Mountains; Shosshone Mountains; Tioyabe Range; Toquima Range; Monitor Range; Hot Creek Range; San Antonio Mountains; Quinn Canyon Range; Kawich Range; Belted Range; Cactus Range; Jarbridge

It is found in alpine and subalpine grassland, alpine talus slides, sage plains, forested woodland bordered by sandstone ledges, the edges of spruce-fir forest, tundra, and juniper savannah (Findley et al. 1975, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). PNV - mixed \"short-grass\", Great Basin Desertscrub, low, semi-arid sagebrush and greasewood desert, through brushy ravines (Thompson et al. 1996). In Colorado, the species is associated with clearings or subclimax grassland (Thompson et al. 1996). It is strongly associated with shrubs at forest edges, disturbed areas, and forest ecotones (Thompson et al. 1996). The Penasco subspecies is found in more open situations, including fencerows bordering agriculture fields and open stands of trees (Thompson et al. 1996). Shrublands and forest clearings are necessary for adult feeding (Thompson et al. 1996). T. minimus eats Vaccinium berries and strawberries, fungi, Russian thistle, currants, prickly pear, thistle, and fleabane (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Hall 1995). It eats the seeds of gilia, bitterroot, sedges, violet, evening primrose, common wild geranium, and grass (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It eats the flowers of alpine parsley, dandelion, and paintbrush (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The home range varies from 0.2 ha to 1.6 ha (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, NatureServe 2001). Maximum distances between captures was 143 to 413 m (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). T. minimus is most frequently found on slopes less than 22 degrees, but may be found on slopes even greater than 67 degrees (Sullivan 1985, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). The elevation is from 1,220-3,900m (Hall 1995, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). Elevation: up to 2800 m. in Nevada, up to 3000 m. in New Mexico, up to 3900 in Colorado (Jezkova 2005). The species retreats to burrows in cold weather (Thompson et al. 1996). T. minimus occurs on the Kaibab Plateau, Chuska-Lukachukai Mountains, and White Mountains in Arizona (Cockrum 1960, Hoffmeister 1986). It is found in the western two-thirds of Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species is present in the northern two-thirds of Nevada except for the low western valleys, probably due to the lack of sagebrush in them (Hall 1995). The chipmunk is found in the Sacramento, Chuska, San Juan, Jemez, Sangre de Cristo, and Sandia mountains in New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). The species occurs throughout Utah (Durrant 1952, Utah GAP 1997). It is found in the Sierra Blanca, Sacramento Mountains, Sandia Mountains, Santa Fe Mountains, Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Jemez Mountains, Tunitcha Mountains, White Mountains, San Juan Mountains, Lukachukai Mountains, Blue Range,  Wasatch Range, Gallinas Mountains, Chuska Mountains, Granite Range in Washoe County, Humboldt Range, East Humboldt Range, Shoshone Mountains, Toquima Range, Monitor Range, Quinn Canyon Mountains, Kawich Mountains, Schell Creek Range, Silver Peak Range, and the Tunitcha Mountains. In California, this species is fairly common in sagebrush, bitterbrush, and various Great Basin shrub habitats. It may also inhabit the brushy understory of open Jeffrey pine and pinyon-juniper areas as well as alpine dwarf-shrub habitats in higher elevation mountain environments ([Harris et al. 2007] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn Washington, this species inhabits shrubsteppe or open forest habitats including sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), antelope bitterbrush, and greasewood and are rarely found in grasslands or closed forest. Most habitat use is adjacent to shrubsteppe and/or open forest and may also utilize low density urban and open space when adjacent to shrubsteppe. Alpine meadows are not within T. minimus' range in the state of Washington (WHCWG 2010, Dalquest 1948, Johnson and Cassidy 1997, Larrison 1947, Feldhamer 1979). In Oregon, T. minimus occurs in shrubsteppe and occasionally open forest edges of ponderosa pine and shrubsteppe. They will also occur in aspen groves with rocky outcrops, sagebrush, greaswood and within heavy soils (such as clays) and avoid grasslands and marshes (Verts and Carraway 1998, Hansen 1956, Feldhamer 1979).\r\n\r\nUpper Midwest:\r\n\"In northern Minnesota, T. minimus was associated with 'recently logged or burned areas, in disturbed habitats around campsites and resorts, and along the rocky shore of Lake Superior\u2019 (Timm 1975). The species also was taken in early seral stands of black spruce (Picea mariana), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) but was replaced by T. striatus in stands of mature pine. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, T. minimus occurs 'in dense upland forest, hardwoods and conifers alike, but it also frequents swamps of white cedar, black spruce, alder, and leatherleaf, as well as rocky and sandy shores, recently burned or cutover areas, rocky  mountain-tops, cleared lands, and openings in the forest grown up to brambles and brush' (Manville 1949). However, in the same region, habitats with good horizontal visibility, medium to dense brush piles, and open canopies were occupied significantly more than habitats with other characteristics (Reilly 1971).\" (quoted directly from Verts and Carrway 2001).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mLECHx", "ELCode": "AMAFB02020", "scientific_name": "Tamias minimus", "ITIS_TSN": "180195", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103812", "common_name": "Least Chipmunk"}}, "GAP ITIS Information": {"hierarchySoFarWRanks": {"Kingdom": "Animalia", "Tribe": "Marmotini", "Genus": "Tamias", "Subgenus": "Tamias (Neotamias)", "Family": "Sciuridae", "Subkingdom": "Bilateria", "Subclass": "Theria", "Order": "Rodentia", "Infraclass": "Eutheria", "Phylum": "Chordata", "Infraphylum": "Gnathostomata", "Superclass": "Tetrapoda", "Suborder": "Sciuromorpha", "Infrakingdom": "Deuterostomia", "Subphylum": "Vertebrata", "Subfamily": "Xerinae", "Class": "Mammalia", "Species": "Tamias minimus"}}}}, {"processing_metadata": {"status": "success", "date_processed": "2019-08-07T15:37:13.338500", "status_message": "Exact Match", "api": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=527d0a83e4b0850ea0518326&format=json&fields=identifiers,files,webLinks,distributionLinks,dates&filter=itemIdentifier%3D{'key': 'Ursus arctos'}"}, "parameters": {"Scientific Name": "Ursus arctos"}, "GAP Species": {"GAP Habitat Map Item": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58fa625ae4b0b7ea5452576d", "GAP Range Map Item": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59f5e1c9e4b063d5d307dae7", "GAP Habitat Map WMS": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/geoserver/CONUS_HabMap_2001/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities", "GAP Modeling Database Parameters URL": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/58fa625ae4b0b7ea5452576d?f=__disk__36%2F79%2F9f%2F36799ff63ef12f553b112c4acb480c8b8207ffdf", "GAP ITIS Information URL": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/58fa625ae4b0b7ea5452576d?f=__disk__17%2Fee%2F53%2F17ee530811f2d5b39ebbffdd6fbda54725ad834c", "GAP Habitat Map File Size": 8263915, "GAP Habitat Map Last Updated": "2019-02-08T11:57:13.138-07:00", "GAP_SpeciesCode": "mBRBEx", "CommonName": "Brown Bear", "ScientificName": "Ursus arctos", "doi": "doi:10.5066/F7Z60MFN", "itis_tsn_validMatch": "180543", "nsid_acceptedMatch": "102187", "iucn_id_verified": "41688", "GAP Range Map WMS": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/geoserver/CONUS_Range_2001/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities", "Range Bounding Box": [-123.31580987639116, 43.37841798831236, -108.86407903271028, 49.002151892919436], "GAP Modeling Database Parameters": {"doi": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7Z60MFN", "input_layers": {"intEdgeEcoWidth": {"Forest/Open Ecotone Only": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "F/O + Shrubland/Woodland": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7T43RZ7"}, "strAvoid": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "ysnHydroWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strForIntBuffer": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "intFromBuffFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intSlopeMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F75D8QQF", "intIntoBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intElevMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F72N515B", "intSlopeMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F75D8QQF", "PrimEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "AuxEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "hucs": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7DZ0754", "intIntoBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intPercentCanopy": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7DZ0754", "ysnUrbanExclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "intElevMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F72N515B", "Region": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F77H1HGT", "ysnHydroOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "ysnUrbanInclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PC318R", "strUseForInt": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "intFromBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strStreamVel": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "strEdgeType": {"Forest/Open Ecotone Only": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4HPN", "F/O + Shrubland/Woodland": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7T43RZ7"}, "strSalinity": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "ysnHydroFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1", "intFromBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7JM28J1"}, "sb_url": "https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58fa625ae4b0b7ea5452576d", "models": {"mBRBEx-y5": {"intPercentCanopy": null, "intIntoBuffFW": null, "ScientificName": "Ursus arctos", "ysnHydroWV": false, "intAuxBuff": null, "strForIntBuffer": null, "intContPatchSize": null, "ysnHandModel": false, "intSlopeMin": null, "intIntoBuffOW": null, "Season": "y", "intElevMax": 3656, "intSlopeMax": null, "PrimEcoSys": [[9826, "Northwestern Great Plains Floodplain"], [4609, "Northern Rocky Mountain Mesic Montane Mixed Conifer Forest"], [9227, "North American Arid West Emergent Marsh"], [9823, "Western Great Plains Floodplain"], [9304, "Northern Rocky Mountain Conifer Swamp"], [8303, "Recently Burned Grassland"], [8108, "Harvested Forest -

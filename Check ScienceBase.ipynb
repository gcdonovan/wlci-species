Although many invaders completely eliminate native plant species from some communities, ecologists know little about the mechanisms by which these exotics competitively exclude other species. Mycorrhizal fungi radically alter competitive interactions between plants within natural communities, and a recent study has shown that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi provide a substantial competitive advantage to spotted knapweed, Centaurea maculosa, a noxious perennial plant that has spread throughout much of the native prairie in the northwestern U.S. Here we present evidence that this advantage is potentially due to mycorrhizally mediated transfer of carbon [...]\",\n",

For each of these species, we recorded germination time courses on bare soil and two types of biological soil crusts; one composed predominantly of the tall moss Tortula ruralis and the other dominated by the short moss Bryum argenteum.

Oregon grape appears to have less potential for vegetative spread than does salal. It produced two to three times fewer rhizome extensions, and rhizome extensions were only half as long as those of salal. Oregon grape seedlings were common in areas of moss ground cover among patches of the two species. Salal seedlings were restricted to decaying logs. Seedling densities of Oregon [...]',\n",

       "    'summary': 'Classically, testosterone (T) was considered the principal regulator of aggression. However, recent studies in birds have found aggression and T uncoupled during the non-breeding season. Circulating testosterone comes with costs such as immunosuppression and energy expenditure. Instead, the pro-hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), is circulated and activated within the brain via conversion into oestradiol (E 2 ), avoiding the costs associated with T. At present the site of DHEA synthesis is unknown. My thesis investigated the existence of an analogous pathway in non-breeding red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus ) with two studies: (a) a field study investigating the effects of E2 on aggression and (b) a laboratory study that attempted [...]',\n",

For many halophytes even when soils are well-watered and night-time shoot and root water loss eliminated, predawn disequilibrium (PDD) between leaf and soil Î¨w can exceed 0.5 MPa.

A male replacement mate that encounters existing broods has options, which include alloparental care or infanticide. Infanticide may be beneficial in some species (Rohwer 1986, Kermott et al. 1990), but in long-lived avian species, like the ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis) that do not renest within a season, infanticide might be detrimental.

Before Rozol® application ferruginous hawks foraged in the untreated and treated subcolonies but after Rozol® application predation by ferruginous hawks was only observed in the treated subcolonies.

       "    'summary': 'From a year-long study of molt in the golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos, we recorded 2069 contour feathers replaced in 137 d (6 May-19 September). Very few contour feathers were lost outside this period. From precise daily counts of feathers lost, and using time series analysis, we identified short-term fluctuations (i.e., 19-d subcycles) around a midsummer peak (i.e., a left-skewed normal distribution). Because these subcycles have never before been reported and because the physiological basis for many aspects of avian molt is poorly known, we offer only hypothetical explanations for the controls responsible for the subcycles. ??

At the ecosystem scale, wildebeest preferred short and intermediate-height grass of moderate greenness during both the wet and dry seasons.

On 20 June 1782 it was chosen as the emblem of the United States of America because of its long life, great strength, and majestic appearance. This selection had its detractors, most notably Benjamin Franklin who expounded on the bald eagle’s “bad moral character.” The bald eagle's scientific name signifies a sea (halo) eagle (aeetos) with a white (leukos) head (cephalus). In adult birds, the distinctive white head and white tail contrast starkly with the dark brown body and wings. When Europeans first arrived on the North American continent there were an estimated one- quarter to one-half million bald eagles. [...]\",\n",

Due to a growing human-footprint and associated anthropogenic food subsidies, raven populations have increased dramatically over the past several years throughout the USA. The sub-arctic region has also witnessed increased urbanization and industrialization, and ravens have taken advantage of these changes. During 2004 and 2006, we surveyed parking lots on a bi-weekly basis in the city of Fairbanks in interior Alaska, showing an influx of ravens in winter.

In the Mojave Desert, common ravens (Corvus corax) have benefited from human-provided resources to increase in population size precipitously in recent years.

During and after Late Wisconsin deglaciation, subalpine tree species (Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa) were rare or absent near the Lowder Creek Bog site, but nonarboreal species predominated. P. engelmannii-A. lasiocarpa forest became well-established there between 11,000 and 9800 yr BP and subalpine trees dominated this elevation throughout the Holocene.

The mice were then exposed to predation by a short-eared owl in each light intensity and search time, chase time, capture time, and the number of escapes/chase were measured.

To promote ecosystem resilience, recent management efforts aim to maintain ecosystem patterns and processes within their historical range of variability. There has been substantial concern that quaking aspen, the most widely distributed tree in North America and the most important deciduous tree in the subalpine forests of the Rocky Mountains, has declined significantly in the western landscape during the 20th century. This reported decline has been attributed to conifer encroachment associated with fire exclusion, as well as other causes. To assess long-term changes in the extent of quaking aspen in a 175000-ha study area in western Colorado, we used a Geographic [...]',\n",

Instead, the pro-hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), is circulated and activated within the brain via conversion into oestradiol (E 2 ), avoiding the costs associated with T. At present the site of DHEA synthesis is unknown.

Therefore, oral delivery is being proposed as a possible option to vaccinate these wild ungulates. One of the main problems associated with oral vaccination is the potential exposure of nontarget species to the vaccines. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of two Brucella vaccines, strain 19 (S19) and the rough strain RB51 (SRB51), in pregnant pronghorn antelope. We conclude that S19 and SRB51 rarely colonize maternal and fetal tissues of pregnant pronghorn [...]',\n",

Long-term effectiveness of these treatments has rarely been evaluated.  2.

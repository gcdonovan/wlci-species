# WLCI Species 

This repository contains code for creating a list of species referenced in Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initative and running it through the Taxa Information Registry, a set of data processing algorithms we are developing under the Biogeographic Information System. This is all very experimental at this stage and should not be used beyond internal evaluation and discussions. The purpose of this exercise is to examine what all information we can bring together from across various available public data sources to aid in the work of evaluating the current state of scientific knowledge about these species.

Data are being built in '/Data Release'.  

Sources:  A literature database of WLCI products was developed in Zotero.  The latest version was exported as CSL JSON and posted to the WLCI Publications SB page: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/4f4e476fe4b07f02db47e19f

This is still very much a work in progress.
